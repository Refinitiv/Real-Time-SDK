# LSEG Real-Time SDK - C/C++ Edition
This is the LSEG Real-Time SDK. This SDK encompasses a couple of APIs: Enterprise Message API (EMA) and the Enterprise Transport API (ETA).

The **Enterprise Message API (EMA)** is an ease of use, open source, OMM API. EMA is designed to provide clients rapid development of applications, minimizing lines of code and providing a broad range of flexibility. It provides flexible configuration with default values to simplify use and deployment. EMA is written on top of the Enterprise Transport API (ETA) utilizing the Value Added Reactor and Watchlist. 

The **Enterprise Transport API (ETA)** is an open source LSEG low-level Transport and OMM encoder/decoder API. It is used by the LSEG Real-Time Distribution Systems and LSEG Real-Time for the optimal distribution of OMM/RWF data and allows applications to achieve the highest performance, highest throughput, and lowest latency. ETA fully supports all OMM constructs and messages. Applications may be written to core ETA (RSSL), to ValueAdd/Reactor layer or to Watchlist layer.

     cJSON                 1.7.18
     curl                  8.12.1
     googletest            1.8.1 (for older than Linux7) and 1.12.1 
     l8w8jwt               2.5.0
     libxml2               2.13.6
     lz4                   1.9.4 (for older than Linux7) and 1.10.0
     zlib                  1.3.1
\* Tested on supported Linux and Windows platforms; \*\* Tested on supported Windows platform 

NOTES: 
- curl and openSSL are dynamically loaded at runtime.  
- Above mentioned version of openSSL was used in test. Please note that the RTSDK package does not build openSSL, and we recommend that all installed versions of openSSL are patched to the latest version available.  
- Default curl libraries and CMake build scripting provided in the RTSDK package are built against the default openSSL version provided by the Linux distribution (RedHat 8, RedHat 9). If the application is using a different version of openSSL than the distribution, one must obtain a version of Curl that links against the same major and minor version of openSSL as the application and rebuild to ensure that one version of openSSL is used. For Windows, the RTSDK package Curl build, links against the Windows schannel library, and does not have the possibility of a version incompatability issue with openSSL.
- openSSL 1.1.1 and higher are required for TLS 1.3
- Cipher suite is configurable with TLS 1.2 and it is recommended that customers use best available ciphers. With TLS 1.3, cipher suite is not yet configurable; however, default ciphers are best available.
- Check installation guide for details regarding including external dependencies for build

NOTE: User has the option to use pre-built libraries or build source natively on a platform of choice. Pre-built libraries for Red Hat 9 and Red Hat 8 are available in release packages available on LSEG Developer Portal. 

NOTE: We do not support container builds with RTSDK C/C++ where RTSDK C/C++ is being built natively using a container. This is because depending on container install, specifically the librarires or toolsets available in that container vs. underlying OS, the build may vary. There are too many combinations for us to state with confidence that build will succeed or is valid with any combination of container and underlying OS. This is because the RTSDK C/C++ build depends on certain system libraries. The open question for any given combination: what is being installing in container vs. using underlying OS libs? Therefore, our stance is that we do not recommend building RTSDK C/C++ editions in a container. We have made changes in CMake to pick up characteristics of container instead of underly OS with RTSDK-9060; however, that does not guarantee a valid build depending on combination of container versus the underlying operating system. An alternate option is to choose the appropriate pre-build libraries from our official archives/packages.

#### Tested Versions

##### Windows
This release has been tested with supported valid OS/compiler combinations.

##### Linux
This release has been tested with the following on supported platform/OS combinations. Please note that the list of tested platforms and compiler combination below reflects test of two use cases: using pre-built libraries to build applications _and_ natively building source and using those libraries to build applications.

Please refer to top level README.md and to Cpp-C/Eta/README.md or Cpp-C/Ema/README.md files to find more information. Sections Cpp-C/Eta/Docs/ and Cpp-C/Ema/Docs contain PDF/HTML documentation. In current directory, please find the test plan with test results: RTSDK-C-Edition\_Test\_Plan.xlsx

# Installation and Build

Please refer to Installation Guide for [ETA](Eta/Docs/RTSDK_C_Installation_Guide.pdf) or [EMA](Ema/Docs/RTSDK_C_Installation_Guide.pdf) for detailed instructions. In this section are some basic details.

## Install RTSDK 
There are 3 ways to install Real-Time SDK:

Obtain the source **from this repository** on GitHub. It will contain all of the required source to build RTSDK as detailed below. In addition, this repository depends on a Binary Pack found in the [release assets](https://github.com/Refinitiv/Real-Time-SDK/releases) section that is auto pulled by a build. The BinaryPack contains libraries for the closed source portions of the product, permitting users to build and link all dependent libraries to have a fully functional product. 

Real-Time SDK packages may also be [downloaded from LSEG Developer Portal](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/real-time-opnsrc/rt-sdk-cc/downloads). In addition, these distributions depend on a Binary Pack found in the above downloads section. This will not be automatically pulled by the build, and must be downloaded and extracted into the ../RTSDK-BinaryPack directory(Same level as the Cpp-C directory in this package). The BinaryPack contains libraries for the closed source portions of the product, permitting users to build and link all dependent libraries to have a fully functional product.

Real-Time SDK packages are also available for download on [MyAccount](https://myaccount.lseg.com/en/downloadcenter). In addition, these distributions depend on a Binary Pack found in the above download location. This will not be automatically pulled by the build, and must be downloaded and extracted into the ../RTSDK-BinaryPack directory(Same level as the Cpp-C directory in this package). The BinaryPack contains libraries for the closed source portions of the product, permitting users to build and link all dependent libraries to have a fully functional product. 

## Building RTSDK

**Using CMake**:

Cmake is required to create the Linux Makefile files and Windows Solution and vcxproj files. To build examples or re-build libraries, user must download [CMake](https://cmake.org) version 3.22.0 (cmake_minimum_required) or later.

In addition, Python 3 is required. This can be installed either through yum or a windows installer.

Refer to RTSDK C/C++ Installation Guide located in Cpp-C/Eta/Docs or Cpp-C/Ema/Docs for more detailed CMake build instructions than what is described below.

**For Linux**:

At the same directory level as the resulting RTSDK directory, issue the following command to build the optimized Makefile files:

     cmake -HsourceDir -BbuildDir
     # sourceDir is is the directory in which the top-level CMake entry point (CMakeLists.txt) resides. By default, when you build using the Solution and vcxproj files, output is sent to directory specified in sourceDir. 
     # buildDir is the directory where all build output is placed. This directory is automatically created.
     # Note: CMake supports Linux 7 build although libraries are no longer shipped. If closed source from BinaryPack is required to build, please use a BinaryPack prior to Real-Time-SDK-2.2.3.L1 to build the deprecated Linux 7 library at your own risk. Changes to BinaryPacks will not be available for deprecated compilers.

Issue the following command to build debug Makefile files:

     cmake -HRTSDK -BbuildDir –DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
     # To build the optimized version replace build type with –DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Optimized and to build optimized debug version, replace with –DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=OptimizedDebug.

The cmake command builds all needed Makefile files (and related dependencies) in the buildDir directory. Go to the buildDir directory and type "make" or "gmake" to create the RTSDK libraries. Note that the libraries and sample application executables are sent to the RTSDK directory under sourceDir.

**For Windows**:

At the same directory level as the resulting RTSDK directory, issue the following command to build the Solution and vcxproj files:

     cmake -HsourceDir -BbuildDir -G <VisualStudioVersion>
     # sourceDir is is the directory in which the top-level CMake entry point (CMakeLists.txt) resides. By default, when you build using the Solution and vcxproj files, output is sent to directory specified in sourceDir. 
     # buildDir is the directory where all build output is placed. This directory is automatically created
     # "VisualStudioVersion" is the visual studio version to use for build on windows.
     # Valid values for VisualStudioVersion are 
          # "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
          # "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 
          # "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
          # "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" 
     # Note: A list of visual studio versions can be obtained by typing "cmake -help". 
     # Note: CMake supports VS 2013 build although libraries are no longer shipped. If closed source from BinaryPack is required to build, please use a BinaryPack prior to Real-Time-SDK-2.0.3.L1 to build these deprecated Visual Studio versions at your own risk. Changes to BinaryPacks will not be available for deprecated compilers.

The cmake command builds all needed Solution and vcxproj files (and other related files) in the buildDir directory. User must open these files and build all libraries and examples in the same manner as with prior RTSDK versions. Note that the libraries and sample application executables are sent to an RTSDK directory under sourceDir.

Alternatively, to build using CMake command line instead of Visual Studio, use this command line: 

     cmake --build . --config Debug_MDd.  
     # In the command above, options for config are Debug_MDd or Release_MD.

Note that your installation of Visual Studio needs to be updated to add Microsoft Foundation Classes per Microsoft when encountering this build error: fatal error RC105: cannot open include file 'afxres.h'.

**32 bit support**:

CMake has build support for 32 bit platforms. This 32-bit support is available only for ETA core RSSL layer.

Linux: Add "-DBUILD\_32\_BIT\_ETA=ON" to the cmake build

Windows: Do not add "Win64" or "-A x64" to the "VisualStudioVersion".  Example, When specifying, "Visual Studio 14 2015", for a 64-bit build it would be "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64". For a 32-bit build, it would be "Visual Studio 14 2015" 

NOTE: Starting with SDK version 1.3.1, DACS libraries are available for 32-bits in the BinaryPack.
NOTE: DACS libraries provided in BinaryPack for VS2019 is copied from VS 2017 as these build is not currently available.
