 /**
 *  @defgroup RSSLIteratorInterfaces Overview: Transport API Encode/Decode Iterator Use
 *  @{
 *
 *  The following sections describe high level usage of the Transport API Encode and Decode Iterators.  Specific iterator structure and function definitions can be found in \ref RsslIteratorGroup.
 *
 *	@section IterOverview Transport API Iterator Overview
 *	When encoding or decoding RWF content with Transport API, the user leverages an iterator to manage the encoding or decoding process.
 *  The Transport API defines a single encode iterator type (\ref RsslEncodeIterator) and a single decode iterator type (\ref RsslDecodeIterator).  A single instance of this iterator
 *  can manage the full depth and breadth of the encoding or decoding process.  Alternatly, multiple iterator instances can be used to individually manage separate portions of the encode
 *  or decode process.  <BR><BR>
 *  The Transport API encoder/decoder does not provide any inherent threading or locking capability.  Separate iterator and type instances do not cause contention and do not share resources between instances.
 *  Any needed threading, locking, or thread-model implementation is at the discretion of the application.  Different application threads can encode or decode different messages without requiring a lock;
 *  thus each thread must use its own iterator instance and each message should be encoded or decoded using unique and independent buffers.  
 *  @note Though possible, Refinitiv recommends that you do not encode or decode related messages (messages flowing on the same stream) on different threads as this can impact the delivery order.
 *
 *	@subsection IterVers Iterator RWF Protocol Versioning 
 *	The Transport API iterators help the user to manage version information associated with the RWF content being exchanged.  When using the Transport API 
 *  Transport the protocol type and version information can be exchanged and negotiated on the connection (via the RsslConnectOptions or RsslBindOptions).  
 *  The Transport API will reject any connection establishment when the protocol type does not match across the connection.  If the protocol type does match,
 *  an appropriate major and minor version will be determined and this should be the version of RWF encoded or decoded when using this connection.
 *  After the connection becomes active, this negotiated version information is available and can then be provided to the iterator to ensure that the proper version is encoded or decoded.
 *  If not using the Transport API, the user can determine the desired version of RWF to encode and specify this information on their iterator.
 *  Transport API provides RWF protocol type and protocol version values in @header "rtr\rsslIterators.h" for this purpose.  
 *  @note Specifying appropriate version information on \ref RsslDecodeIterator and \ref RsslEncodeIterator is important to future-proof applications and avoid incompatability if new RWF functionality is added.
 *
 *  See \ref RsslIteratorVersion for more information about Iterator Versioning.
 *  
 *  @section DecodeIter Transport API Decode Iterator Overview
 *  All RWF decoding requires the use of an \ref RsslDecodeIterator, where a single iterator can manage the full decoding process.  
 *  For instance, if the application is decoding a message containing an RsslFieldList, the same \ref RsslDecodeIterator can be used
 *  to decode the RsslFieldList, all RsslFieldEntry, and all types (primitive types or container types) housed in the entries. 
 *  Seperate iterators can be used as well, depending on the needs of the application.  Following the same example, one 
 *  \ref RsslDecodeIterator can be used to decode the message information (up to the beginning of the RsslFieldList payload).  
 *  Another \ref RsslDecodeIterator reference can be used to decode the RsslFieldList and entries, and if desired, other 
 *  iterators can be used to decode the contents of each RsslFieldEntry.<BR><BR>
 *  Before decoding begins, the iterator should be initialized to ready it for decoding.  Initialization consists of several steps.  
 *  The rsslClearDecodeIterator() function can be used to initialize (or re-initialize for reuse) the \ref RsslDecodeIterator.  
 *  After clearing, an \ref RsslBuffer containing the content to decode should be associated with the \ref RsslDecodeIterator.
 *  In addition, RWF version information should be provided to the \ref RsslDecodeIterator so the desired version of RWF is 
 *  decoded.<BR><BR>
 *  See \ref RsslDecodeIteratorType for more information and code examples.<BR><BR><BR>
 *  
 *  @section EncodeIter Transport API Encode Iterator Overview
 *  All RWF encoding requires the use of an \ref RsslEncodeIterator, where a single iterator can manage the full encoding process.
 *  For instance, if the application is encoding a message containing an RsslFieldList, the same \ref RsslEncodeIterator can be used
 *  to encode the message header information, the RsslFieldList information, each RsslFieldEntry, and the content of each entry 
 *  (primitive types or container types).  Seperate iterators can be used as well, depending on the needs of the application.  
 *  Following the same example, one \ref RsslEncodeIterator can be used to pre-encode an entry's content.  This pre-encoded content
 *  can then be set on the RsslFieldEntry and encoded using the \ref RsslEncodeIterator that is encoding the RsslFieldList.  This
 *  encoded field list content can then be set on the RsslMsg and yet another \ref RsslEncodeIterator can be used to encode the message
 *  and its pre-encoded payload.<BR><BR>
 *  Before encoding begins, the iterator should be initialized to ready it for the encoding process.  Initialization consists of several steps.
 *  The rsslClearEncodeIterator() function can be used to initialize (or re-initalize for reuse) the \ref RsslEncodeIterator.
 *  After clearing, an \ref RsslBuffer with ample memory should be associated with the iterator; this will be the buffer that
 *  content is encoded into (if using with the Transport API, this is often a buffer obtained from the rsslGetBuffer() function so it can be immediatley written after encoding completes).
 *  In addition, RWF version information should be provided to the \ref RsslEncodeIterator so the desired version of RWF is encoded.
 *  @note When encoding is complete, the user should query the length of encoded content, setting this information in the \ref RsslBuffer::length.  
 *  If encoding fails, the \ref RsslEncodeIterator can be used to roll back content to the last successful encoding point.  <BR><BR>
 *  See \ref RsslEncodeIteratorType for more information and code examples.<BR><BR><BR>

 * @brief Transport API encode and decode iterators are used to manage the process for all RWF encoding and decoding.
 *
 * The Transport API Iterator functionality is defined in @header "rtr/rsslIterators.h"
 *
 *	@section RsslIterOverview Transport API Iterator Overview
 *	When encoding or decoding RWF content with the Transport API, the user leverages an iterator to manage the encoding or decoding process.
 *  The Transport API defines a single encode iterator type (\ref RsslEncodeIterator) and a single decode iterator type (\ref RsslDecodeIterator).  A single instance of this iterator
 *  can manage the full depth and breadth of the encoding or decoding process.  Alternatly, multiple iterator instances can be used to individually manage separate portions of the encode
 *  or decode process.  <BR><BR>
 *  The Transport API encoder/decoder does not provide any inherent threading or locking capability.  Separate iterator and type instances do not cause contention and do not share resources between instances.
 *  Any needed threading, locking, or thread-model implementation is at the discretion of the application.  Different application threads can encode or decode different messages without requiring a lock;
 *  thus each thread must use its own iterator instance and each message should be encoded or decoded using unique and independent buffers.  
 *  @note Though possible, Refinitiv recommends that you do not encode or decode related messages (messages flowing on the same stream) on different threads as this can impact the delivery order.
 *
 *  See \ref RsslIteratorVersion for information about encoding or decoding the correct version of RWF with the iterator.<BR>

/**

 *  @brief Detailed information about RWF versioning and the iterator.
 *  @{
 * 
 *	The Transport API iterators help the user to manage version information associated with the RWF content being exchanged.  When using the Transport API 
 *  Transport the protocol type and version information can be exchanged and negotiated on the connection (via the RsslConnectOptions or RsslBindOptions).  
 *  The Transport API will reject any connection establishment when the protocol type does not match across the connection.  If the protocol type does match,
 *  an appropriate major and minor version will be determined and this should be the version of RWF encoded or decoded when using this connection.
 *  After the connection becomes active, this negotiated version information is available and can then be provided to the iterator to ensure that the proper version is encoded or decoded.
 *  If not using the Transport API, the user can determine the desired version of RWF to encode and specify this information on their iterator.
 *  The Transport API provides RWF protocol type and protocol version values in @header "rtr\rsslIterators.h" for this purpose.  
 *  @note Specifying appropriate version information on \ref RsslDecodeIterator and \ref RsslEncodeIterator is important to future-proof applications and avoid incompatability if new RWF functionality is added.
 *
 *  @section IterVersUseExample Transport API Iterator Versioning Examples
 *  The following code example demonstrates associating version information with a Transport API iterator.
 *	@code
 *	//Create RsslEncodeIterator on the stack (this is the same process for RsslDecodeIterator)
 *	RsslEncodeIterator encIter;
 *	//Clear iterator
 *	rsslClearEncodeIterator(&encIter);
 *	//Associate RWF version (note that the clear function sets this to the 
 *	//default version - this only needs to be set if desired encode or decode version is different.

 *	{
 *		//Handle error appropriatley 
 *		return 0;

/**

 *  @brief Detailed information about the RsslDecodeIterator
 *  @{
 *
 *  All RWF decoding requires the use of an \ref RsslDecodeIterator, where a single iterator can manage the full decoding process.  
 *  For instance, if the application is decoding a message containing an RsslFieldList, the same \ref RsslDecodeIterator can be used
 *  to decode the RsslFieldList, all RsslFieldEntry, and all types (primitive types or container types) housed in the entries. 
 *  Seperate iterators can be used as well, depending on the needs of the application.  Following the same example, one 
 *  \ref RsslDecodeIterator can be used to decode the message information (up to the beginning of the RsslFieldList payload).  
 *  Another \ref RsslDecodeIterator reference can be used to decode the RsslFieldList and entries, and if desired, other 
 *  iterators can be used to decode the contents of each RsslFieldEntry.<BR><BR>
 *  Before decoding begins, the iterator should be initialized to ready it for decoding.  Initialization consists of several steps.  
 *  The rsslClearDecodeIterator() function can be used to initialize (or re-initialize for reuse) the \ref RsslDecodeIterator.  
 *  After clearing, an \ref RsslBuffer containing the content to decode should be associated with the \ref RsslDecodeIterator.
 *  In addition, RWF version information should be provided to the \ref RsslDecodeIterator so the desired version of RWF is 
 *  decoded.<BR><BR>

 *  The RsslSeries container type allows the user to represent an implicitly indexed collection of uniform entries (e.g. each entry houses the same container type).  
 *  All contained RsslSeriesEntry house the same container type, with the type information specified in the RsslSeries::containerType.
 *  This is well suited for sending infrequently or non-updating table like content, where each RsslSeriesEntry represents an additional row in a table.

 *  @{
 *
 *  The RsslFilterList container type allows the user to represent an 8-bit ID indexed collection of non-uniform entries (e.g. each entry can house a different container type).
 *  Each RsslFilterEntry contains an 8-bit id corresponding to one of 32 possible bit-value identifiers.  These identifiers
 *  are typically defined by a domain model specification and can be used to indicate interest or presence of specific
 *  entries through the inclusion of the id in the RsslMsgKey::filter. 
 *  Each contained RsslFilterEntry can house a different container type.  If RsslFilterEntry::containerType is present, this indicates the type housed in the entry.  Otherwise, the entry houses the type indicated by RsslFilterList::containerType.<BR>
 *
 * 
 *  @section FilterListUseExample RsslFilterList Creation Examples
 *  The following code example demonstrates stack creation and initialization of an RsslFilterList and RsslFilterEntry.  This also demonstrates the use of the clear function to reuse the structures.

 * @section CopyMsgExample RsslCopyMsg Usage Example
 * The following code example demonstrates the usage of \ref rsslCopyMsg() with a user-allocated buffer. 
 * In this case, the user is expected to pre-allocate the memory that \ref rsslCopyMsg will copy to.
 * @code
 * // This RsslMsg should already have been populated by the user.
 * RsslMsg SourceMsg;
 * // RsslMsg pointer for final copy location
 * RsslMsg *CopyMsg;
 * // User allocated buffer
 * RsslBuffer copyBuf;
 * // Doing a full, deep copy of the message. Message does not have a filter list.
 * RsslUInt32 copyFlags = RSSL_CMF_ALL_FLAGS;
 * RsslUInt32 filter = 0;
 *
 * // Find size of the source message and allocate memory.
 * copyBuf.length = rsslSizeOfMsg(&SourceMsg, copyFlags);
 * copyBuf.data = (char*)malloc(copyBuf.length);
 *
 * // Copy message into copyBuf.
 * CopyMsg = rsslCopyMsg(&SourceMsg, copyFlags, filter, &copyBuf);
 * 
 * // ... //
 * 
 * // When done with the Copied Message, free the data buffer.
 * free(copyBuf.data);
 * @endcode
 * <BR><BR>
 * This code example demonstrates the usage of \ref rsslCopyMsg() without a user-allocated buffer. 
 * Here, the user is expected to use \ref rsslReleaseCopiedMsg() to free the allocated memory.
 * @code
 * // This RsslMsg should already have been populated by the user.
 * RsslMsg SourceMsg;
 * // RsslMsg pointer for final copy location
 * RsslMsg *CopyMsg;
 * // Doing a full, deep copy of the message. Message does not have a filter list.
 * RsslUInt32 copyFlags = RSSL_CMF_ALL_FLAGS;
 * RsslUInt32 filter = 0;
 *
 * // Copy message into copyBuf.
 * CopyMsg = rsslCopyMsg(&SourceMsg, copyFlags, filter, NULL);
 * 
 * // ... //
 * 
 * // When done with the Copied Message, free the data buffer.
 * rsslReleaseCopiedMsg(CopyMsg);
