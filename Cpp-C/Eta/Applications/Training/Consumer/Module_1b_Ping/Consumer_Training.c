/*
 * This is the ETA Consumer Training series of the ETA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step 
 * training how to build a ETA OMM Consumer using the ETA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main c source file for the ETA Consumer Training application. It is a 
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, the application initializes the ETA Transport and 
 * connects the client. An OMM consumer application can establish a 
 * connection to other OMM Interactive Provider applications, including 
 * LSEG Real-Time Distribution Systems, Data Feed Direct,
 * and LSEG Real-Time.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any ETA consumer application is to establish a 
 * network connection with its peer component (i.e., another application 
 * with which to interact). User must start a interactive provider (server) or a 
 * non-interactive provider which connects to an ADH. 
 * There are training examples available for Providers and NIProviders.
 * An OMM consumer typically creates an outbound 
 * connection to the well-known hostname and port of a server (Interactive 
 * Provider or ADS). The consumer uses the rsslConnect() function to initiate 
 * the connection and then uses the rsslInitChannel() function to complete 
 * channel initialization. 
 * 
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * Ping or heartbeat messages indicate the continued presence of an application. 
 * After the consumer’s connection is active, ping messages must be exchanged. 
 * The negotiated ping timeout is retrieved using the rsslGetChannelInfo() function. 
 * The connection will be terminated if ping heartbeats are not sent or received 
 * within the expected time frame.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of 
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information 
 * is being exchanged. For example, there may be long periods of time that 
 * elapse between requests made from an OMM consumer application. In this 
 * situation, the consumer would send periodic heartbeat messages to inform 
 * the providing application that it is still alive. Because the provider 
 * application is likely sending more frequent information, providing updates 
 * on any streams the consumer has requested, it may not need to send 
 * heartbeats as the other data is sufficient to announce its continued 
 * presence. It is the responsibility of each connection to manage the sending
 * and receiving of heartbeat messages.

	/* This example suite uses write descriptor in our client/consumer type examples in mainly 2 areas with
	* the I/O notification mechanism being used:
	* Details of those functions could be found in API development guide.

	/* This example suite uses write descriptor in our client/consumer type examples in mainly 2 areas with
	 * the I/O notification mechanism being used:
	 * 1) rsslInitChannel() function which exchanges various messages to perform necessary ETA transport
	 *    negotiations and handshakes to complete channel initialization.
	 * 2) rsslFlush() calls used throughout the application (after module 1a), together with rsslWrite() calls, such
	 *    as in sendMessage() function. The write descriptor can be used to indicate when the socketId has write
	 *    availability and help with determining when the network is able to accept additional bytes for writing.
	 *
	 * For the RsslChannel initialization process, if using I/O, a client/consumer application should register the
	 * RsslChannel.socketId with the read, write, and exception file descriptor sets. When the write descriptor
	 * alerts the user that the socketId is ready for writing, rsslInitChannel is called (this sends the
	 * initial connection handshake message). When the read file descriptor alerts the user that the socketId
	 * has data to read, rsslInitChannel is called - this typically reads the next portion of the handshake.
	 * This process would continue until the connection is active.
	 *
	 * Typically, calls to rsslInitChannel are driven by I/O on the connection, however this can also be
	 * accomplished by using a timer to periodically call the function or looping on a call until the channel
	 * transitions to active or a failure occurs. Other than any overhead associated with the function call,
	 * there is no harm in calling rsslInitChannel more frequently than required. If no work is required at
	 * the current time, the function will return and indicate that connection is still in progress.
	 */

	/* This example suite also uses a clean FD sets and a dirty FD sets for I/O notification.

	 *		select() - a system call for examining the status of file_descriptors.
	 *					Tells us that there is data to read on the FDs.

	 * Since select() modifies its file descriptor sets, if the call is being used in a loop, then the fd sets must
	 * be reinitialized before each call. Since they act as input/output parameters for the select() system call;
	 * they are read by and modified by the system call. When select() returns, the values have all been modified
	 * to reflect the set of file descriptors ready. So, every time before you call select(), you have to
	 * (re)initialize the fd_set values. Here we maintain 2 sets FD sets:
	 * a) clean FD sets so that we can repeatedly call select call
	 * b) dirty FD sets used in the actual select call (I/O notification mechanism)
	 * Typically, you reset the dirty FD sets to be equal to the clean FD sets before you call select().
