/*
 * This is the ETA Consumer Training series of the ETA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step 
 * training how to build a ETA OMM Consumer using the ETA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main h header file for the ETA Consumer Training application. It is a 
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, the application initializes the ETA Transport and 
 * connects the client. An OMM consumer application can establish a 
 * connection to other OMM Interactive Provider applications, including 
 * LSEG Real-Time Distribution Systems, Data Feed Direct,
 * and LSEG Real-Time.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any ETA consumer application is to establish a 
 * network connection with its peer component (i.e., another application 
 * with which to interact). An OMM consumer typically creates an outbound 
 * connection to the well-known hostname and port of a server (Interactive 
 * Provider or ADS). The consumer uses the rsslConnect() function to initiate 
 * the connection and then uses the rsslInitChannel() function to complete 
 * channel initialization.
 * 
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * Ping or heartbeat messages indicate the continued presence of an application. 
 * After the consumer’s connection is active, ping messages must be exchanged. 
 * The negotiated ping timeout is retrieved using the rsslGetChannelInfo() function. 
 * The connection will be terminated if ping heartbeats are not sent or received 
 * within the expected time frame.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of 
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information 
 * is being exchanged. For example, there may be long periods of time that 
 * elapse between requests made from an OMM consumer application. In this 
 * situation, the consumer would send periodic heartbeat messages to inform 
 * the providing application that it is still alive. Because the provider 
 * application is likely sending more frequent information, providing updates 
 * on any streams the consumer has requested, it may not need to send 
 * heartbeats as the other data is sufficient to announce its continued 
 * presence. It is the responsibility of each connection to manage the sending
 * and receiving of heartbeat messages.
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 1c: Reading and Writing Data
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * When channel initialization is complete, the state of the channel 
 * (RsslChannel.state) is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, and applications can send 
 * and receive data.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * When a client or server RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to receive data from the connection. The 
 * arrival of this information is often announced by the I/O notification 
 * mechanism that the RsslChannel.socketId is registered with. The ETA 
 * Transport reads information from the network as a byte stream, after 
 * which it determines RsslBuffer boundaries and returns each buffer one by 
 * one.
 * 
 * When a client or server RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to write data to the connection. Writing 
 * involves a several step process. Because the ETA Transport provides 
 * efficient buffer management, the user is required to obtain a buffer 
 * from the ETA Transport buffer pool. This can be the guaranteed output 
 * buffer pool associated with an RsslChannel. After a buffer is acquired, 
 * the user can populate the RsslBuffer.data and set the RsslBuffer.length 
 * to the number of bytes referred to by data. If queued information cannot 
 * be passed to the network, a function is provided to allow the application 
 * to continue attempts to flush data to the connection. An I/O notification
 * mechanism can be used to help with determining when the network is able 
 * to accept additional bytes for writing. The ETA Transport can continue to
 * queue data, even if the network is unable to write. 
 * 
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 2: Log in
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * Applications authenticate using the Login domain model. An OMM consumer must 
 * authenticate with a provider using a Login request prior to issuing any other 
 * requests or opening any other streams. After receiving a Login request, an 
 * Interactive Provider determines whether a user is permissioned to access the 
 * system. The Interactive Provider sends back a Login response, indicating to 
 * the consumer whether access is granted.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * After receiving a Login request, an Interactive Provider determines whether 
 * a user is permissioned to access the system. The Interactive Provider sends 
 * back a Login response, indicating to the consumer whether access is granted.
 * 
 * a) If the application is denied, the Login stream is closed, and the 
 * consumer application cannot send additional requests.
 * b) If the application is granted access, the Login response contains 
 * information about available features, such as Posting, Pause and Resume, 
 * and the use of Dynamic Views. The consumer application can use this 
 * information to tailor its interaction with the provider.
 *
 * Content is encoded and decoded using the ETA Message Package and the ETA 
 * Data Package.
