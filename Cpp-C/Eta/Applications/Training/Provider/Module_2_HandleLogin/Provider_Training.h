 * This is the ETA Interactive Provider Training series of the ETA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step 
 * training how to build a ETA OMM Interactive Provider using the ETA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main h header file for the ETA Interactive Provider Training application. It is a 
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Interactive Provider Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * An OMM Interactive Provider application opens a listening socket on a well-known 
 * port allowing OMM consumer applications to connect. Once connected, consumers 
 * can request data from the Interactive Provider.
 * 
 * In this module, the OMM Interactive Provider application opens a listening socket 
 * on a well-known port allowing OMM consumer applications to connect.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any ETA Interactive Provider application is to establish 
 * a listening socket, usually on a well-known port so that consumer applications 
 * can easily connect. The provider uses the rsslBind function to open the port 
 * and listen for incoming connection attempts.
 * Whenever an OMM consumer application attempts to connect, the provider uses 
 * the rsslAccept function to begin the connection initialization process.
 * 
 * For this simple training app, the interactive provider only supports a single client. 
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Interactive Provider Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, after establishing a connection, ping messages might 
 * need to be exchanged. The negotiated ping timeout is available via 
 * the RsslChannel. If ping heartbeats are not sent or received within 
 * the expected time frame, the connection can be terminated. LSEG 
 * recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the 
 * size of the ping timeout.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * Once the connection is active, the consumer and provider applications 
 * might need to exchange ping messages. A negotiated ping timeout is available 
 * via RsslChannel corresponding to each connection (this value might differ on
 * a per-connection basis). A connection can be terminated if ping heartbeats 
 * are not sent or received within the expected time frame. LSEG 
 * recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the size of the ping timeout.
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of 
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information is 
 * being exchanged. Because the provider application is likely sending more frequent 
 * information, providing updates on any streams the consumer has requested, 
 * it may not need to send heartbeats as the other data is sufficient to announce 
 * its continued presence. It is the responsibility of each connection to manage 
 * the sending and receiving of heartbeat messages.
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Interactive Provider Training Module 1c: Reading and Writing Data
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, when a client or server RsslChannel.state is 
 * RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is possible for an application to receive 
 * data from the connection. Similarly, when a client or server 
 * RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is possible for an 
 * application to write data to the connection. Writing involves a several 
 * step process. 
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * When a client or server RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to receive data from the connection. The 
 * arrival of this information is often announced by the I/O notification 
 * mechanism that the RsslChannel.socketId is registered with. The ETA 
 * Transport reads information from the network as a byte stream, after 
 * which it determines RsslBuffer boundaries and returns each buffer one by 
 * one.
 *
 * When a client or server RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to write data to the connection. Writing 
 * involves a several step process. Because the ETA Transport provides 
 * efficient buffer management, the user is required to obtain a buffer 
 * from the ETA Transport buffer pool. This can be the guaranteed output 
 * buffer pool associated with an RsslChannel. After a buffer is acquired, 
 * the user can populate the RsslBuffer.data and set the RsslBuffer.length 
 * to the number of bytes referred to by data. If queued information cannot 
 * be passed to the network, a function is provided to allow the application 
 * to continue attempts to flush data to the connection. An I/O notification
 * mechanism can be used to help with determining when the network is able 
 * to accept additional bytes for writing. The ETA Transport can continue to
 * queue data, even if the network is unable to write. 
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA Interactive Provider Training Module 2: Perform/Handle Login Process
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * Applications authenticate with one another using the Login domain model. 
 * An OMM Interactive Provider must handle the consumer’s Login request messages 
 * and supply appropriate responses.
 * 
 * In this module, after receiving a Login request, the Interactive Provider 
 * can perform any necessary authentication and permissioning.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * After receiving a Login request, the Interactive Provider can perform any 
 * necessary authentication and permissioning.
 *
 * a) If the Interactive Provider grants access, it should send an RsslRefreshMsg 
 * to convey that the user successfully connected. This message should indicate 
 * the feature set supported by the provider application.
 * b) If the Interactive Provider denies access, it should send an RsslStatusMsg, 
 * closing the connection and informing the user of the reason for denial.
 *
 * The login handler for this simple Interactive Provider application only allows
 * one login stream per channel. It provides functions for processing login requests
 * from consumers and sending back the responses. Functions for sending login request
 * reject/close status messages, initializing the login handler, and closing login streams 
 * are also provided.
 *
 * Also please note for simple training app, the interactive provider only supports 
 * one client session from the consumer, that is, only supports one channel/client connection.
 *
 * Content is encoded and decoded using the ETA Message Package and the ETA 
 * Data Package.
