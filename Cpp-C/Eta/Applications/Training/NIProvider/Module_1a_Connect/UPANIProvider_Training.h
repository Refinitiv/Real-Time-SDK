 * This is the UPA NI Provider Training series of the UPA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step 
 * training how to build a UPA OMM NI Provider using the UPA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main h header file for the UPA NI Provider Training application. It is a 
 * single-threaded client application.

 ************************************************************************
 * UPA NI Provider Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * A Non-Interactive Provider (NIP) writes a provider application that 
 * connects to TREP-RT and sends a specific set (non-interactive) of 
 * information (services, domains, and capabilities). NIPs act like 
 * clients in a client-server relationship. Multiple NIPs can connect 
 * to the same TREP-RT and publish the same items and content. 
 * 
 * In this module, the OMM NIP application initializes the UPA Transport 
 * and establish a connection to an ADH server. Once connected, an OMM NIP 
 * can publish information into the ADH cache without needing to handle 
 * requests for the information. The ADH can cache the information and 
 * along with other Enterprise Platform components, provide the information 
 * to any OMM consumer applications that indicate interest.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any UPA NIP application is to establish network 
 * communication with an ADH server. To do so, the OMM NIP typically creates 
 * an outbound connection to the well-known hostname and port of an ADH. 
 * The consumer uses the rsslConnect function to initiate the connection 
 * process and then performs connection initialization processes as needed.
