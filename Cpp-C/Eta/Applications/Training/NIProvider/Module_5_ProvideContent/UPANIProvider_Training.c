/*
 * This is the UPA NI Provider Training series of the UPA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step 
 * training how to build a UPA OMM NI Provider using the UPA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main c source file for the UPA NI Provider Training application. It is a 
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA NI Provider Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * A Non-Interactive Provider (NIP) writes a provider application that 
 * connects to TREP-RT and sends a specific set (non-interactive) of 
 * information (services, domains, and capabilities). NIPs act like 
 * clients in a client-server relationship. Multiple NIPs can connect 
 * to the same TREP-RT and publish the same items and content. 
 * 
 * In this module, the OMM NIP application initializes the UPA Transport 
 * and establish a connection to an ADH server. Once connected, an OMM NIP 
 * can publish information into the ADH cache without needing to handle 
 * requests for the information. The ADH can cache the information and 
 * along with other Enterprise Platform components, provide the information 
 * to any OMM consumer applications that indicate interest.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any UPA NIP application is to establish network 
 * communication with an ADH server. To do so, the OMM NIP typically creates 
 * an outbound connection to the well-known hostname and port of an ADH. 
 * The OMM NIP uses the rsslConnect function to initiate the connection 
 * process and then performs connection initialization processes as needed.
 * 
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA NI Provider Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, after establishing a connection, ping messages might 
 * need to be exchanged. The negotiated ping timeout is available via 
 * the RsslChannel. If ping heartbeats are not sent or received within 
 * the expected time frame, the connection can be terminated. Thomson 
 * Reuters recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the 
 * size of the ping timeout.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of 
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information 
 * is being exchanged. For example, there may be long periods of time that 
 * elapse between requests made from an OMM NIP application to ADH Infrastructure.
 * In this situation, the NIP would send periodic heartbeat messages to inform 
 * the ADH Infrastructure that it is still alive.
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA NI Provider Training Module 1c: Reading and Writing Data
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, when a client or server RsslChannel.state is 
 * RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is possible for an application to receive 
 * data from the connection. Similarly, when a client or server 
 * RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is possible for an 
 * application to write data to the connection. Writing involves a several 
 * step process. 
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * When a client or server RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to receive data from the connection. The 
 * arrival of this information is often announced by the I/O notification 
 * mechanism that the RsslChannel.socketId is registered with. The UPA 
 * Transport reads information from the network as a byte stream, after 
 * which it determines RsslBuffer boundaries and returns each buffer one by 
 * one.
 * 
 * When a client or server RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to write data to the connection. Writing 
 * involves a several step process. Because the UPA Transport provides 
 * efficient buffer management, the user is required to obtain a buffer 
 * from the UPA Transport buffer pool. This can be the guaranteed output 
 * buffer pool associated with an RsslChannel. After a buffer is acquired, 
 * the user can populate the RsslBuffer.data and set the RsslBuffer.length 
 * to the number of bytes referred to by data. If queued information cannot 
 * be passed to the network, a function is provided to allow the application 
 * to continue attempts to flush data to the connection. An I/O notification
 * mechanism can be used to help with determining when the network is able 
 * to accept additional bytes for writing. The UPA Transport can continue to
 * queue data, even if the network is unable to write. 
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA NI Provider Training Module 2: Log in
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, applications authenticate with one another using the Login 
 * domain model. An OMM NIP must register with the system using a Login request 
 * prior to providing any content. Because this is done in an interactive manner, 
 * the NIP should assign a streamId with a positive value which the ADH will 
 * reference when sending its response.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * After receiving a Login request, the ADH determines whether the NIP is 
 * permissioned to access the system. The ADH sends a Login response, indicating 
 * to the NIP whether the ADH grants it access. 
 * 
 * a) If the application is denied, the ADH closes the Login stream and the 
 * NI provider application cannot perform any additional communication. 
 * b) If the application gains access to the ADH, the Login response informs 
 * the application of this. The NI provider must now provide a Source Directory.
 * 
 * Content is encoded and decoded using the UPA Message Package and the UPA 
 * Data Package. 
 * 
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA NI Provider Training Module 3: Provide Source Directory Information
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, OMM NIP application provides Source Directory information.
 * The Source Directory domain model conveys information about all available 
 * services in the system. After completing the Login process, an OMM NIP must 
 * provide a Source Directory refresh.
 * 
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The Source Directory domain model conveys information about all 
 * available services in the system. After completing the Login process, 
 * an OMM NIP must provide a Source Directory refresh indicating:
 * 
 * a) Service, service state, QoS, and capability information associated 
 * with the NIP
 * b) Supported domain types and any item group information associated 
 * with the service.
 * 
 * At a minimum, Thomson Reuters recommends that the NIP send the Info, 
 * State, and Group filters for the Source Directory. Because this is provider 
 * instantiated, the NIP should use a streamId with a negative value.
 * 
 * a) The Source Directory Info filter contains service name and serviceId 
 * information for all available services, though NIPs typically provide data 
 * on only one service.
 * b) The Source Directory State filter contains status information for service. 
 * This informs the ADH whether the service is Up and available or Down and 
 * unavailable.
 * c) The Source Directory Group filter conveys item group status information, 
 * including information about group states as well as the merging of groups. 
 * For additional information about item groups, refer to UPAC Developer Guide.
 * 
 * Content is encoded and decoded using the UPA Message Package and the UPA 
 * Data Package.
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA NI Provider Training Module 4: Load Dictionary Information
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * Dictionaries may be available locally in a file for an OMM NIP appliation. In 
 * this Training example, the OMM NIP will use dictionaries that are available 
 * locally in a file.
 * 
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * Some data requires the use of a dictionary for encoding or decoding. This 
 * dictionary typically defines type and formatting information and directs 
 * the application as to how to encode or decode specific pieces of information. 
 * Content that uses the RsslFieldList type requires the use of a field dictionary 
 * (usually the Thomson Reuters RDMFieldDictionary, though it could also be a 
 * user-defined or modified field dictionary).
 * 
 * Dictionaries may be available locally in a file for an OMM NIP appliation. In 
 * this Training example, the OMM NIP will use dictionaries that are available 
 * locally in a file.
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA NI Provider Training Module 5: Provide Content
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, after providing a Source Directory, the OMM NIP application can 
 * begin pushing content to the ADH. In this simple example, we just show functions 
 * for sending 1 MP(MarketPrice) domain type Item refresh, update, and
 * close status message(s) to an ADH. 
 * 
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * After providing a Source Directory, the NIP application can begin pushing content 
 * to the ADH. Each unique information stream should begin with an RsslRefreshMsg, 
 * conveying all necessary identification information for the content. Because the 
 * provider instantiates this information, a negative value streamId should be used 
 * for all streams. The initial identifying refresh can be followed by other status
 * or update messages. Some ADH functionality, such as cache rebuilding, may require 
 * that NIP applications publish the message key on all RsslRefreshMsgs. See the 
 * component specific documentation for more information.
 * 
 * Some components may require that NIP applications publish the msgKey in RsslUpdateMsgs. 
 * To avoid component or transport migration issues, NIP applications may want to always 
 * include this information. 
 * 
 * Content is encoded and decoded using the UPA Message Package and the UPA 
 * Data Package.

	/* For this simple training app, only a single channel/connection is used for the entire life of this app. */

	/* This example suite uses write descriptor in our client/NI Provider type examples in mainly 2 areas with
	 * the I/O notification mechanism being used:
	 * 1) rsslInitChannel() function which exchanges various messages to perform necessary UPA transport
	 *    negotiations and handshakes to complete channel initialization.
	 * 2) rsslFlush() calls used throughout the application (after module 1a), together with rsslWrite() calls, such
	 *    as in sendMessage() function. The write descriptor can be used to indicate when the socketId has write
	 *    availability and help with determining when the network is able to accept additional bytes for writing.
	 *
	 * For the RsslChannel initialization process, if using I/O, a client/NI Provider application should register the
	 * RsslChannel.socketId with the read, write, and exception file descriptor sets. When the write descriptor
	 * alerts the user that the socketId is ready for writing, rsslInitChannel is called (this sends the
	 * initial connection handshake message). When the read file descriptor alerts the user that the socketId
	 * has data to read, rsslInitChannel is called - this typically reads the next portion of the handshake.
	 * This process would continue until the connection is active.
	 *
	 * Typically, calls to rsslInitChannel are driven by I/O on the connection, however this can also be
	 * accomplished by using a timer to periodically call the function or looping on a call until the channel
	 * transitions to active or a failure occurs. Other than any overhead associated with the function call,
	 * there is no harm in calling rsslInitChannel more frequently than required. If no work is required at
	 * the current time, the function will return and indicate that connection is still in progress.
	 */

	/* This example suite also uses a clean FD sets and a dirty FD sets for I/O notification.

	 *		select() - a system call for examining the status of file_descriptors.
	 *					Tells us that there is data to read on the FDs.

	 * Since select() modifies its file descriptor sets, if the call is being used in a loop, then the fd sets must
	 * be reinitialized before each call. Since they act as input/output parameters for the select() system call;
	 * they are read by and modified by the system call. When select() returns, the values have all been modified
	 * to reflect the set of file descriptors ready. So, every time before you call select(), you have to
	 * (re)initialize the fd_set values. Here we maintain 2 sets FD sets:
	 * a) clean FD sets so that we can repeatedly call select call
	 * b) dirty FD sets used in the actual select call (I/O notification mechanism)
	 * Typically, you reset the dirty FD sets to be equal to the clean FD sets before you call select().
