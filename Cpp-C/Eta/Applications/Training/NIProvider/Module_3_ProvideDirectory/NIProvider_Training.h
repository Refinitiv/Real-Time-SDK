 * This is the ETA NI Provider Training series of the ETA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step 
 * training how to build a ETA OMM NI Provider using the ETA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main h header file for the ETA NI Provider Training application. It is a 
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA NI Provider Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * A Non-Interactive Provider (NIP) writes a provider application that 
 * connects to LSEG Real-Time Distribution System and sends a specific
 * set (non-interactive) of information (services, domains, and capabilities).
 * NIPs act like clients in a client-server relationship. Multiple NIPs can
 * connect to the same LSEG Real-Time Distribution System and publish
 * the same items and content.
 * 
 * In this module, the OMM NIP application initializes the ETA Transport 
 * and establish a connection to an ADH server. Once connected, an OMM NIP 
 * can publish information into the ADH cache without needing to handle 
 * requests for the information. The ADH can cache the information and 
 * along with other LSEG Real-Time Distribution System components, 
 * provide the information to any NIProvider applications that indicate interest.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any ETA NIP application is to establish network 
 * communication with an ADH server. To do so, the OMM NIP typically creates 
 * an outbound connection to the well-known hostname and port of an ADH. 
 * The OMM NIP uses the rsslConnect function to initiate the connection 
 * process and then performs connection initialization processes as needed.
 * 
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA NI Provider Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, after establishing a connection, ping messages might 
 * need to be exchanged. The negotiated ping timeout is available via 
 * the RsslChannel. If ping heartbeats are not sent or received within 
 * the expected time frame, the connection can be terminated. LSEG 
 * recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the 
 * size of the ping timeout.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of 
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information 
 * is being exchanged. For example, there may be long periods of time that 
 * elapse between requests made from an OMM NIP application to ADH Infrastructure.
 * In this situation, the NIP would send periodic heartbeat messages to inform 
 * the ADH Infrastructure that it is still alive.
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA NI Provider Training Module 1c: Reading and Writing Data
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, when a client or server RsslChannel.state is 
 * RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is possible for an application to receive 
 * data from the connection. Similarly, when a client or server 
 * RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is possible for an 
 * application to write data to the connection. Writing involves a several 
 * step process. 
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * When a client or server RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to receive data from the connection. The 
 * arrival of this information is often announced by the I/O notification 
 * mechanism that the RsslChannel.socketId is registered with. The ETA 
 * Transport reads information from the network as a byte stream, after 
 * which it determines RsslBuffer boundaries and returns each buffer one by 
 * one.
 *
 * When a client or server RsslChannel.state is RSSL_CH_STATE_ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to write data to the connection. Writing 
 * involves a several step process. Because the ETA Transport provides 
 * efficient buffer management, the user is required to obtain a buffer 
 * from the ETA Transport buffer pool. This can be the guaranteed output 
 * buffer pool associated with an RsslChannel. After a buffer is acquired, 
 * the user can populate the RsslBuffer.data and set the RsslBuffer.length 
 * to the number of bytes referred to by data. If queued information cannot 
 * be passed to the network, a function is provided to allow the application 
 * to continue attempts to flush data to the connection. An I/O notification
 * mechanism can be used to help with determining when the network is able 
 * to accept additional bytes for writing. The ETA Transport can continue to
 * queue data, even if the network is unable to write. 
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA NI Provider Training Module 2: Log in
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, applications authenticate with one another using the Login 
 * domain model. An OMM NIP must register with the system using a Login request 
 * prior to providing any content. Because this is done in an interactive manner, 
 * the NIP should assign a streamId with a positive value which the ADH will 
 * reference when sending its response.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * After receiving a Login request, the ADH determines whether the NIP is 
 * permissioned to access the system. The ADH sends a Login response, indicating 
 * to the NIP whether the ADH grants it access. 
 * 
 * a) If the application is denied, the ADH closes the Login stream and the 
 * NI provider application cannot perform any additional communication. 
 * b) If the application gains access to the ADH, the Login response informs 
 * the application of this. The NI provider must now provide a Source Directory.
 * 
 * Content is encoded and decoded using the ETA Message Package and the ETA 
 * Data Package. 
 * 
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA NI Provider Training Module 3: Provide Source Directory Information
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, OMM NIP application provides Source Directory information.
 * The Source Directory domain model conveys information about all available 
 * services in the system. After completing the Login process, an OMM NIP must 
 * provide a Source Directory refresh.
 * 
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The Source Directory domain model conveys information about all 
 * available services in the system. After completing the Login process, 
 * an OMM NIP must provide a Source Directory refresh indicating:
 * 
 * a) Service, service state, QoS, and capability information associated 
 * with the NIP
 * b) Supported domain types and any item group information associated 
 * with the service.
 * 
 * At a minimum, LSEG recommends that the NIP send the Info, 
 * State, and Group filters for the Source Directory. Because this is provider 
 * instantiated, the NIP should use a streamId with a negative value.
 * 
 * a) The Source Directory Info filter contains service name and serviceId 
 * information for all available services, though NIPs typically provide data 
 * on only one service.
 * b) The Source Directory State filter contains status information for service. 
 * This informs the ADH whether the service is Up and available or Down and 
 * unavailable.
 * c) The Source Directory Group filter conveys item group status information, 
 * including information about group states as well as the merging of groups. 
 * For additional information about item groups, refer to ETAC Developer Guide.
 * 
 * Content is encoded and decoded using the ETA Message Package and the ETA 
 * Data Package.
