rsslVANIProvider Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate non-interactively providing
Level I Market Price and Level 2 Market By Order data to an Advanced Data Hub(ADH)
using ValueAdd components. It is a single-threaded client application.

The consumer application implements callbacks that process information received
by the ADH. It creates the RsslReactor, creates the desired connections, then
dispatches from the RsslReactor for events and messages. Once it has received the
event indicating that the channel is ready, it begins sending refresh and update
messages for the given items.

Reliable multicast can be used to communicate between this application and any
ADH on the network. Then the non-interactive provider can send one message to
all ADH's on the network instead of having to fan-out messages to each ADH
TCP/IP connection. 

This application can optionally use the Value Add payload cache component. If the 
cache option is enabled, the OMM payload for all items will be stored
in the cache. If the connection is down, updates will continue to be cached
until the connection recovers. If items are cached, refreshes will be encoded
from the cache entry.

This application is intended as a basic usage example. Some of the design choices
were made to favor simplicity and readability over performance. This application
is not intended to be used for measuring performance.

Application Name:
-----------------

VANIProvider

------------------
Setup Environment:
------------------

The RDMFieldDictionary and enumtype.def files located in the etc directory
must be located in the directory of execution. If the dictionary files
cannot be found, the non-interactive provider application exits.

-------------------
Command line usage:
-------------------  

./VANIProvider -tcp <hostname>:<port> <service name>  <item list> [-runtime <seconds>] [-cache] [-at <AuthenticationToken>] [-ax <AuthenticationExtended>] [-aid <ApplicationId>]

For multicast connections:

./VANIProvider -segmentedMulticast <send address>:<send port>:<network interface address> 
	<receive address>:<receive port> <unicast port> <service name> <item list> [-runtime <seconds>] [-cache] 

The items list is a comma-separated pair of <domain:item name>.  The domains for the item 
list may be any of: mp(MarketPrice), mbo(MarketByOrder)

Specifying the -runtime option controls the time the application will run
before exiting, in seconds.

Specifying the -at option configures the token used for TREP Authentication.  This should be used 
in place of a userName.  This token is retrieved from a token generator, and passed to TREP, which
will verify the token against a token validator.  For more information about the TREP Authentication
feature, please see the Developers guide and the TREP Authentication guide.  

Specifying the -ax option configures the authentication extended information used for TREP Authentication.

Specifying the -aid option configures the Application Id.

- VANIProvider -? displays command line options.

- Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program. 

-----------------
Compiling Source:
-----------------

The included makefile is set up to run from the file
locations as presented through the distribution package.
It is set up for building on the Transport API supported 
Solaris or Linux platforms using the supported compilers.

The VA_CUSTOM_BUILT_LIBS value in the makefile is used to 
link in the Transport API ValueAdd components compiled from the provided
source code.  If a custom library is used, VA_CUSTOM_BUILT_LIBS 
should be set to Yes.  In addition, the user should point the 
VA_INCLUDE locations to the location where the directory of 
the current platform's library is built.

The LINKTYPE value in the makefile is used to control
whether the application is built using Transport API static or
shared libraries. The default build uses Transport API static
libraries. To use Transport API shared libraries,
set LINKTYPE=Shared.

To compile, run the gmake command.

Gmake can be obtained at http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
