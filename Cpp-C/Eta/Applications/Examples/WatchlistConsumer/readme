rsslWatchlistConsumer Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate consuming data from an 
ADS device, OMM Provider application or Elektron Real Time in Cloud (ERT in cloud)
using ValueAdd components.  It is a single-threaded client application.

This application leverages the consumer watchlist feature provided by the
RsslReactor to provide recovery and aggregation of items. Using the 
consumer watchlist feature also enables this application to consume
from either an OMM Provider or ADS over a socket-based connection, or from
an ADS over a multicast network.  It requests items within the 
channelOpenCallback function, which are automatically requested by the
RsslReactor on its behalf when the channel connects to the providing component.

If the dictionary is found in the directory of execution, then it is loaded
directly from the file.  However, the default configuration for this application
is to request the dictionary from the provider.  Hence, no link to the dictionary
is made in the execution directory by the build script.  The user can change this
behavior by manually creating a link to the dictionary in the execution directory.

This application supports consuming Level I Market Price, Level II Market 
By Order, Level II Market By Price, and Yield Curve. This application 
optionally performs on-stream posting for Level I Market Price content.  

This application supports a symbol list request. When requesting a symbol
list, it also requests that the RsslReactor automatically open streams
using the item names that appear in the list.

This application can optionally perform on-stream and off-stream posting for Level I
Market Price content. The item name used for an off-stream post is "OFFPOST". For
simplicity, the off-stream post item name is not configurable, but users can modify
the code if desired.

This application can open tunnel streams to a provider that supports them (via the -tunnel option),
such as the included provider example.

This application is intended as a basic usage example.  Some of the design 
choices were made to favor simplicity and readability over performance.  
This application is not intended to be used for measuring performance.

WatchlistConsumer

------------------
Setup Environment:
------------------

The RDMFieldDictionary and enumtype.def files located in the etc directory
can be located in the directory of execution.  If the dictionary files
cannot be found, they are requested from the provider.

Both the shared version of libcurl and the openssl libraries are needed to run this example for 
connecting and consuming data from the Elektron Real Time in Cloud (ERT in cloud).

-------------------
Command line usage:
-------------------  

WatchlistConsumer

(runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14002 -s DIRECT_FEED -mp TRI))

or

WatchlistConsumer -c encrypted -ec socket -s <service name> -u <machine ID> -passwd <password> -clientId <client ID> -sessionMgnt

The above example command line is used to create an encrypted connection with the socket encrypted protocol type
using the default "us-east" region and enable session management to login and subscribe data from ERT in cloud.

or

WatchlistConsumer or WatchlistConsumer [ -c <Connection Type> ] [ -ec <encrypted protocol> ]
  [ -if <Interface Name> ] [ -u <Login UserName> ] [ -passwd <Login password> ] [ -clientId <Client ID> ]
  [ -sessionMgnt ] [ -takeExclusiveSignOnControl <true/false> ] [ -l <Location Name> ] [ -query ] 
  [ -s <ServiceName>] [ -mp <MarketPrice ItemName> ] [ -mbo <MarketByOrder ItemName> ]
  [ -mbp <MarketByPrice ItemName> ] [ -yc <YieldCurve ItemName> ] [ -sl <SymbolList ItemName> ]
  [ -sld <SymbolList ItemName> ] [ -view ] [ -runTime <TimeToRun> ] [-at <AuthenticationToken>] 
  [-ax <AuthenticationExtended>] [-aid <ApplicationId>]

  Connection options for socket, http, and encrypted connection types:
    [ -h <Server Hostname> ] [ -p <Port> ]

  Connection options for the reliable multicast connection type; all must be specified:
    [ -sa <Send Address> ] [ -ra <Receive Address> ] [ -sp <Send Port> ] [ -rp <Receive Port> ]
	[ -up <Unicast Port> ]

  Options for publishing Host Stat Message options on reliable multicast connections; -hsmAddr and -hsmPort must be specified to enable:
    [ -hsmAddr <Address> ] [ -hsmPort <Port> ] [ -hsmInterface <Interface Name> ] [ -hsmInterval <seconds> ]

  Options for tunnel streams:
    [-tunnel] [-tsAuth] [-tsServiceName <name> ]

The -c option specifies the connection type. Valid arguments are socket, http, encrypted, and 
reliableMCast.  When using a socket, http, or encrypted connection, use the -h and -p options
to configure the address and port for connecting. When using a reliableMcast connection,
use the -sa, -ra, -sp, -rp, and -up options to configure the multicast network.

The -ec option specifies the encrypted transport protocol. Valid arguments are socket, and http.  
Http is only supported on Windows Platforms.\n"

The -clientId option specifies an unique ID for authenticating with the EDP token service (mandatory).
You can generate and manage client Ids at the following URL: https://emea1.apps.cp.thomsonreuters.com/apps/AppkeyGenerator
(you need an Eikon login to access this page)

Specifying the -sessionMgnt option enables session management in the Reactor to perform
authentication token management and query EDP-RT service discovery(if -query is not specified)
on be half of users.

Specifying the -takeExclusiveSignOnControl <true/false> option will set exclusive sign on control to force sign-out
for the same credentials when enabling the session management. Defaults to true.

The -l option specifies a location name that is used to get an endpoint from the
EDP service discovery information. Defaults to "us-east".

Specifying the -query option to query the EDP service discovery to get an endpoint
according to the specified connection type and location name.

The user can specify multiple instances of -mp, -mbo, -mbp, -yc, -sl and -sld,
where each occurrence is associated with a single item. For example, 
specifying "-mp TRI -mp GOOG -mbo AAPL" will issue requests for two 
MarketPrice items and one MarketByOrder item.  The -sld option is like the -sl 
option, but will request that data streams be opened for items present in the 
symbol list response.

Specifying the -view option results in a dynamic view request for any MarketPrice
items.  If the provider does not indicate support for dynamic views, the RsslReactor will forward
the item request without the view.

Specifying the -post option enables the consumer application to attempt on-stream
posting to the provider. When a provider supports posting, the consumer will post to
the first successfully established MarketPrice stream. If no MarketPrice items are 
requested, on-stream posting will be disabled. While on-stream posting, the application
will alternate between a Post message that contains another message and a Post message
that contains only data payload. 

The -tsServiceName option may be used to specify the name of the service used for tunnel stream
messaging. If not specified, the service name used will be the same as the service name specified
by the -s option.

The -tsAuth option causes the consumer to use authentication when performing tunnel stream
messaging.

The -tsDomain option specifies the domainType to use when opening the tunnel stream,
for the simple tunnel stream messaging.

Specifying the -at option configures the token used for TREP Authentication.  This should be used 
in place of a userName.  This token is retrieved from a token generator, and passed to TREP, which
will verify the token against a token validator.  For more information about the TREP Authentication
feature, please see the Developers guide and the TREP Authentication guide.

Specifying the -ax option configures the authentication extended information used for TREP Authentication.

Specifying the -aid option configures the Application Id.

Specifying the -runTime option controls the time the application will run
before exiting, in seconds.
