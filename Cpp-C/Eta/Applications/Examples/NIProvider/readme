rsslNIProvider Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------
 
The purpose of this application is to non-interactively provide Level I Market
Price and Level 2 Market By Order data to an Advanced Data Hub (ADH). It is a 
single-threaded client application. First the application initializes the RSSL transport 
and connects the client. After that, it attempts to load the dictionary from a file. 
The application sends a login request like a consumer to the ADH.
A source directory refresh message is published to the ADH without any request for it.
If the dictionary could not be loaded from a file and the login response from ADH 
indicates that the ADH does support the Provider Dictionary Download feature
the application will send dictionary request like a consumer and proccess the 
dictionary refresh message.
If the ADH login response indicates no support for the Provider Dictionary Download feature
the application will exit.
A market price and/or market by order refresh/update messages are published
to the ADH without any request for them.

If the dictionary is found in the directory of execution, then it is loaded
directly from the file. However, the default configuration for this application
is to request the dictionary from the ADH. Hence, no link to the dictionary
is made in the execution directory by the build script. The user can change this
behavior by manually creating a link to the dictionary in the execution directory.

Reliable multicast can be used to communicate between this application and any
ADH on the network. The non-interactive provider can then send one message to
all ADH's on the network instead of having to fan-out messages to each ADH
TCP/IP connection. 

This application is intended as a basic usage example. Some of the design choices
were made to favor simplicity and readability over performance. This application
is not intended to be used for measuring performance.

NIProvider

------------------
Setup Environment:
------------------

The RDMFieldDictionary and enumtype.def files located in the etc directory
can be located in the directory of execution. If the dictionary files
cannot be found and the ADH does support the Provider Dictionary Download feature,
they are requested from the ADH via dictionary request message.
If dictionary files can not be located in the directory of execution
and ADH does not support the Provider Dictionary Download feature
the non-interactive provider application exits.

-------------------
Command line usage:
-------------------  

NIProvider
(runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14003 -s DIRECT_FEED -mp TRI))

or 

NIProvider.exe [-uname <LoginUsername>] [-s <ServiceName>] [-id <ServiceId>] [-mp <MarketPrice Item Name>] [-mbo <MarketByOrder Item Name>] [ -x ] [-runtime <seconds>] [-at <AuthenticationToken>] [-ax <AuthenticationExtended>] [-aid <ApplicationId>]

 -mp For each occurance, provides item using Market Price domain.
 -mbo For each occurance, provides item using Market By Order domain.

 -id allows user to specify optional serviceId.
 
 -x provides an XML trace of messages.
 -runtime adjusts the running time of the application.

If using TCP Socket:
[-h <InfraHostname>] [-p <InfraPortNo>]

If using Reliable Multicast:
[-sa <SendAddress>] [-sp <SendPort>]
[-ra <RecvAddress>] [-rp <RecvPort>]
[-u <UnicastPort>] [-i <Interface>]

If using Host Stat Messages on a Reliable Multicast connection:
  [-hsmAddr <Address>] [-hsmPort <Port>] [-hsmInterface <Interface>] [-hsmInterval <Seconds>]

The user can specify multiple -mp instances, where each occurrence is associated with
a single item. For example, specifying -mp TRI -mp GOOG will provide content for two
MarketPrice items.

Similarly, the user can specify multiple -mbo instances, where each occurrence is associated with
a single item. For example, specifying -mbo TRI -mbo GOOG will provide content for two
MarketByOrder items.

Specifying the -id option allows the application to indicate the serviceID to associate
with the service being provided on.

If using reliable multicast, the following options apply.

Specifying the -sa option configures the send address of a segmented reliable multicast network.

Specifying the -sp option configures the send port of a segmented reliable multicast network.

Specifying the -ra option configures the receive address of a segmented reliable multicast network.

Specifying the -rp option configures the receive port of a segmented reliable multicast network.

Specifying the -u option configures the unicast port of the reliable multicast network.

Specifying the -i option configures the network interface of the reliable multicast network.

Specifying the -runtime option controls the time the application will run
before exiting, in seconds.

Specifying the -at option configures the token used for UserAuthn Authentication.  This should be used 
in place of a userName.  This token is retrieved from a token generator, and passed to
LSEG Real-Time Distribution, which will verify the token against a token validator.
For more information about the UserAuthn Authentication feature, please see the Developers guide and
the UserAuthn Authentication guide. 

Specifying the -ax option configures the authentication extended information used for UserAuthn Authentication.

Specifying the -aid option configures the Application Id.

- NIProvider -? displays command line options.

- Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.

Compiling Source:
-----------------

The included makefile is set up to run from the file
locations as presented through the distribution package.
It is set up for building on the Transport API supported 
Linux platforms using the supported compilers.

The LINKTYPE value in the makefile is used to control
whether the application is built using Transport API static or
shared libraries. The default build uses Transport API static
libraries. To use Transport API shared libraries,
set LINKTYPE=Shared.

To compile, run the gmake command.

Gmake can be obtained at http://www.gnu.org/software/make/

For windows platform, using Visual Studio, open one of the included vcxproj project
files and build.
