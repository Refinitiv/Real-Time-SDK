rsslVAConsumer Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate consuming data from
an OMM Provider, ADS device, OMM Provider application or Refinitiv 
Real-Time Optimized using ValueAdd components.  It is a
single-threaded client application.

The consumer application implements callbacks that process information
received by the provider.  It creates the RsslReactor, creates the
desired connections, then dispatches from the RsslReactor for events and
messages.  Once it has received the event indicating that the channel is 
ready, it will make the desired item requests (snapshot or streaming) to 
a provider and appropriately processes the responses. The resulting decoded 
responses from the provider are displayed on the console.

If the dictionary is found in the directory of execution, then it is loaded
directly from the file.  However, the default configuration for this application
is to request the dictionary from the provider.  Hence, no link to the dictionary
is made in the execution directory by the build script.  The user can change this
behavior by manually creating a link to the dictionary in the execution directory.

This application supports consuming Level I Market Price, Level II Market By
Order, Level II Market By Price and Yield Curve. This application optionally performs
on-stream posting for Level I Market Price content.  

This application can optionally perform on-stream and off-stream posting for Level I
Market Price content. The item name used for an off-stream post is "OFFPOST". For
simplicity, the off-stream post item name is not configurable, but users can modify
the code if desired.

If multiple item requests are specified on the command line for the same domain and
the provider supports batch requests, this application will send the item requests as a
single Batch request.

If supported by the provider and the application requests view use, a dynamic
view will be requested with all Level I Market Price requests.  For simplicity,
this view is not configurable but users can modify the code to change the
requested view.  

This application supports a symbol list request. The symbol list name is optional.
If the user does not provide a symbol list name, the name is taken from the source
directory response.

This application can optionally use the Value Add payload cache component for storing
the OMM payload of the open items in a cache associated with each connection. When using
cache, payload from refreshes and updates are written to cache, instead of decoded to
the console. The contents of the cache are retrieved and decoded to the console at the
end of the application runtime. Optionally, the contents of cache can also be displayed
periodically during application runtime.

This application can open tunnel streams to a provider that supports them (via the -tunnel option),
such as the included provider example.

This application is intended as a basic usage example.  Some of the design choices
were made to favor simplicity and readability over performance.  This application 
is not intended to be used for measuring performance.

Application Name:
-----------------

VAConsumer

------------------
Setup Environment:
------------------

The RDMFieldDictionary and enumtype.def files located in the etc directory
can be located in the directory of execution.  If the dictionary files
cannot be found, they are requested from the provider.

Both the shared version of libcurl and the openssl libraries are needed to run this example for 
connecting and consuming data from Refinitiv Real-Time Optimized. 

-------------------
Command line usage:
-------------------  

VAConsumer 
(runs with a default set of paramters(-tcp localhost:14002 DIRECT_FEED mp:TRI -tcp localhost:14002 DIRECT_FEED mp:.DJI))

or

VAConsumer [-tcp [<hostname>:<port> <service>] [<domain>:<item name>,...] [-uname <LoginUsername>] [-passwd <LoginPassword>] [-clientId <Client ID>] [-sessionMgnt] [-takeExclusiveSignOnControl <true/false> ] [-at <AuthenticationToken>] [-ax <AuthenticationExtended>] [-aid <ApplicationId>] [-view] [-post] [-offpost] [-snapshot] [-x] [-runtime <seconds>] [-cache] [-cacheInterval <seconds>] [-statisticInterval <seconds>] [-qSourceName <name>] [-qDestName <name>] [-tsServiceName <service>] [-tunnel] [-tsAuth] [-tsDomain]

-tcp specifies creating a channel on the given host and port, a service to request items from, and the list of items to request.

The domains for the item list may be any of: mp(MarketPrice), mbo(MarketByOrder), mbp(MarketByPrice), yc(YieldCurve), sl(SymbolList)
The domain may also be any of the private stream domains: mpps(MarketPrice PS), mbops(MarketByOrder PS), mbpps(MarketByPrice PS), ycps(YieldCurve PS)

	Example Usage: -tcp localhost:14002 DIRECT_FEED mp:TRI,mp:GOOG,mpps:FB,mbo:MSFT,mbpps:IBM,yc:YCMAT01,sl

Symbol list requests may optionally specify a name, e.g. "sl:_UPA_ITEM_LIST." If a name is not
specified, the consumer will use the ItemList from the directory response.

Specifying the -sessionMgnt option enables session management in the Reactor to perform
authentication token management and query Refinitiv Data Platform service discovery on be half of users.

Specifying the -takeExclusiveSignOnControl <true/false> option will set exclusive sign on control to force sign-out
for the same credentials when enabling the session management. Defaults to true.

Specifying the -view option will result in a dynamic view being requested with any
MarketPrice items.  If the provider does not indicate support for dynamic views, this
functionality will not be performed.

Specifying the -post option will enable the consumer application to attempt on-stream
posting to the provider.  When a provider supports posting, the consumer will post to
the first successfully established MarketPrice stream.  If no MarketPrice items are 
requested, posting will be disabled.  While posting, the appliation will alternate
between a Post message that contains another message and a Post message that contains
only data payload. 

Specifying the -offpost option will enable the consumer application to attempt off-stream
posting to the VAprovider.  When a VAprovider supports posting, the consumer will post to 
the login stream.

Specifying the -snapshot option results in a non-streaming or "snapshot" request for
all items.

Specifying the -runtime option controls the time the application will run
before exiting, in seconds.

Specifying the -cache option will store each received refresh or update payload into
a cache, instead of decoding to the console. 

Specifying the -cacheInterval will set the number of seconds between the display of the
cache contents. The default value is 0: cache contents are not displayed at regular intervals,
but only displayed on exit when runtime completes.

Specifying the -statisticInterval will set the number of seconds between the display of the
channel statistics.

The -tunnel option opens a tunnel stream to the provider for exchanging simple messages.
This option may be specified once per channel.

The -tsServiceName option may be used to specify the name of the service used for tunnel stream
messaging. This option is associated with a channel (specified by the -tcp option).  If not 
specified, the service name used will be the same as the service name specified for the channel 
via the -tcp option. 

The -tsAuth option causes the consumer to use authentication when performing tunnel stream
messaging.  Like the other tunnel stream messaging options, this is associated with a channel
(specified by the -tcp option). This option may be specified once per channel.

The -tsDomain option specifies the domainType to use when opening the tunnel stream, for the
simple tunnel messaging. Like the other tunnel stream messaging options, this is associated
with a channel (specified by the -tcp option). This option may be specified once per channel.

Specifying the -at option configures the token used for TREP Authentication.  This should be used 
in place of a userName.  This token is retrieved from a token generator, and passed to TREP, which
will verify the token against a token validator.  For more information about the TREP Authentication
feature, please see the Developers guide and the TREP Authentication guide.

Specifying the -ax option configures the authentication extended information used for TREP Authentication.

Specifying the -aid option configures the Application Id.

or 

VAConsumer -encryptedSocket <service name> mp:TRI.N -uname <machine ID> -passwd <password> -clientId <Client ID> -sessionMgnt

The above example command line is used to create an encrypted connection with the socket encrypted protocol type
using the default "us-east" region and enable session management to login and subscribe TRI.N from
Refinitiv Real-Time Optimized.

- VAConsumer -? displays command line options.  

- Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
