ConsPerf Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------
 
The purpose of this application is to measure performance of the Transport API,
encoders and decoders in consuming Level I Market Price content directly
from an OMM provider or through the LSEG Real-Time Distribution System. 

The consumer creates two types of threads:
- A main thread, which collects and records statistical information,
- Consumer threads, each of which create a connection to a provider and
request market data.

To measure latency, a timestamp is randomly placed in each burst of updates by 
the provider.  The consumer then decodes the timestamp from the update to
determine the end-to-end latency.  ConsPerf also supports measurement of 
posting latency.

This application also measures memory and CPU usage.  The memory usage measured 
is the 'resident set,' or the memory currently in physical use by the 
application.  The CPU usage is the total time using the CPU divided by the 
total system time (The CPU time is the total across all threads, and as such 
this number can be greater than 100% if multiple threads are busy).  

For more detailed information on the performance measurement applications, 
see the Transport API C Open Source Performance Tools Guide
(PerfTools/Docs/PerfToolsGuide.doc).

This application uses Libxml2, an open source C-language XML parser library.
See the readme in the provided Libxml2 source for more details.

ConsPerf

------------------
Setup Environment:
------------------

The following configuration files are required:
- RDMFieldDictionary and enumtype.def, located in the etc directory.
- 350k.xml, located in PerfTools/Common
- MsgData.xml, located in PerfTools/Common (only required if posting)

-------------------
Command line usage:
-------------------  

ConsPerf
(runs with a default set of parameters. The full set of configurable 
 parameters is printed to the screen. )

- ConsPerf -? displays command line options, with a brief description
   of each option.  

- Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.  

-----------------
Compiling Source:
-----------------

The included makefile is set up to run from the file
locations as presented through the distribution package.
It is set up for building on the Transport API supported 
Linux platforms using the supported compilers.

The LINKTYPE value in the makefile is used to control
whether the application is built using Transport API static or
shared libraries. The default build uses Transport API static
libraries. To use Transport API shared libraries,
set LINKTYPE=Shared.

To compile, run the gmake command.

Gmake can be obtained at http://www.gnu.org/software/make/

For windows platform, using Visual Studio, open one of the included vcxproj project
files and build.
