/* Implements aggregation of multiple lists of field IDs into a single list, to
 * aid in aggregation of requested views on a stream. */

/* These functions are written to properly maintain the overall view of a stream while
 * changing it only when necessary.
 *
 * The functions work as follows:
 *   Adding a view:
 *     Don't change the overall view yet; just add it to a list of new views.
 *
 *   Remove:
 *     If view was merged into the overall view, decrement the counts of matching fields.
 *     If the view was not committed, remove these fields immediately. Otherwise, leave them
 *     (see Commit section below).
 *   
 *   Merge:
 *     Add all the views to the overall view's list of fields.  If fields were added,
 *     or zero-count fields were found, the view should be considered updated.
 * 
 *   Unmerge:
 *     This should only be done when the overall view has been merged but the attempt
 *     to send the updated view failed.
 *     Reverts the overall view to its state before the new views were merged in.
 *     Any fields that the unmerge sets to zero-count should be removed(but zero-count fields
 *     that were not a result of the unmerge should remain).
 *
 *   Encode:
 *     Encodes the RsslArray representing the overall view. Zero-count fields should be skipped.
 *
 *   Commit:
 *     Perform this after an updated overall view is successfully sent on a stream.
 *     Considers all newly-merged views to be committed.
 *     All zero-count fields can now be removed.
 *     
 *   By keeping the zero-count fields in place until a commit, the overall view
 *   can efficiently maintain the full list of fields while only reporting a change when fields
 *   are actually added or removed.
 *
