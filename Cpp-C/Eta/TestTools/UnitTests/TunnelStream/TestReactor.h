 * This class represents a single Reactor.
 * It providers simple ways to connect components (such as a consumer and provider)
 * and dispatch for events. The dispatched events are copied (including any underlying data such as 
 * messages) and stored into an event queue. You can then retrieve those events and test that they are 
 * correct.
