Definition QATools: The purpose of QATools is to test variations of examples (see Applications/Examples). For each example that is altered to run a test, there will be a directory here to represent that variation. Example: If VAConsumer was altered 2 times to do 2 different tests, there will be directories here, such as, "VAConsumer-*01" and "VAConsumer*02". In each directory are the files that have been altered. These directories contain ONLY the files that were altered for that example.

How to use QATools: For each QATool direcotry, user must copy or overlay the source files from that directory into the original location in Applications/Examples where the entire source for an example exists.  The user must re-build the code to run the altered example. 

Disclaimer:  Please note that this is not a comprehensive list of all test variations used in test.

          Then this sends item RESUME on both handles with initial image set to false
    -m 10: Send request for two TRI.N market price items on different handles

           Then this code unregisters second handle after 10 seconds
    -m 13: Sends request for RES-DS. On first handle request RES-DS. 
           On second handle, request RES-DS as a private stream.
           Extra NOTE: For this code change to be used, user must run a Provider 
           that support RES-DS (private stream re-direct)
    -m 16: Sends request for items in multiple domains and default domain (domain not specified)
           Requests sent on default domain are for both streaming and snapshot.
    -m 17: Requests these market price items: TRI.N, A.N (snapshot), TRI.N

           After a delay, it un-registers 3rd handle requesting TRI.N
    -m 20: Requests these market price items: TRI.N, A.N (snapshot), TRI.N
           After a delay, it sends reissue on first handle (TRI.N) with initial image set to true 
    -m 21: Requests these items using domain 8: TRI.N, TRI.N
           After a delay, it sends reissue on first handle (TRI.N) with initial image set to true

           After, 20 seconds, sends resume.
    -m 27: Requests market price item. After a delay, this un-registers item handle and then login handle.  
    -m 28: Registers 2 login handles and requests market price item. Both handles get data from this item request.
           After delay, un registers second login handle (first should still get data).
           After delay, un registers first login handle.
    -m 30: Requests these market price items: TRI.N with view.
           After 2 seconds, sends login reissue with PAUSE flag.
           After 5 seconds, sends login reissue to resume data.

    Alters consumer which supports an authentication to do offstream posting.


Module:  Series400Consumer440
-----------------------------
Series400Consumer440-TS-001
    Alters consumer to accept these options: -m <1-99>
    Explanation of -m: Each value passed as a argument to this option will run a different test.  
    Below is a list of tests:
    -m 1 Sets CosDataIntegrity::ReliableEnum, CosGuarantee::NoneEnum, 
           CosFlowControl::BidirectionalEnum
    -m 2 Sets CosDataIntegrity::ReliableEnum, CosGuarantee::NoneEnum, CosFlowControl::NoneEnum

    -m 4 Sets CosDataIntegrity::BestEffortEnum, CosGuarantee::NoneEnum, CosFlowControl::NoneEnum
    -m 5 Sets CosDataIntegrity::ReliableEnum, CosGuarantee::NoneEnum, 
         CosFlowControl::BidirectionalEnum ,it set recvWindowSize( 20 )
    -m 6 Sets CosDataIntegrity::ReliableEnum, CosGuarantee::PersistentQueueEnum, 
         CosFlowControl::BidirectionalEnum 

Series400Consumer440-TsFrag-001
    Alters consumer to accept -bufSize and -fillSize as inputs.
    The bufSize is the size of buffer requested by getBuffer().  
    The fillSize is is the number of bytes written.  
    For example, if bufSize is 1000 and fillSize is 900, then the Consumer gets 
    a buffer of 1000 bytes but only writes 900 bytes before sending. The filled 
    buffer is sent to the provider/ads in fragments if larger than max fragment 
    size. This code change fills the buffer with "1, 2, 3....255" and repeats 
    this pattern of data up to the fillSize. The provider will then need to check 
    for the same pattern in the fully assembled message and print "TEST PASSED".
