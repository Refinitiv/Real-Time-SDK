	\class refinitiv::ema::access::DataType DataType.h "Access/DataType.h"
	\brief DataType class provides enumeration representing Omm data types.

	DataType::DataTypeEnum is a numeric and symbolic representation of Omm data type.

	DataType class is used to convert the numeric representation into string representation.

	\code

	const Payload& payload = refreshMsg.getPayload();

	std::cout << "Received payload is " << DataType( payload.getDataType() ) << endl;

	\endcode
