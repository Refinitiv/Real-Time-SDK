Summary
=======

ex511_RequestRouting_ProgrammaticCfg is an example of an OMM Consumer application
written to the EMA library.

This application demonstrates basic usage of the EMA library for accessing and
parsing of OMM MarketPrice Domain data from Data Feed Direct,
directly from an OMM Provider application, or from the Advanced
Distribution Server.

feature to route market data item requests to multiple connections depending
on the availability of each connection. This example gets a session channel
information from OmmConsumerEvent.

This example uses the programmatic configuration to enable the request routing feature.
