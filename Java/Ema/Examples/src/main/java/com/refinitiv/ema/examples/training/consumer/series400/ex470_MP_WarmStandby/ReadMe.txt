Summary
=======

ex470_MP_WarmStandby is an example of an OMM Consumer application
written to the EMA library.

This application demonstrates basic usage of the EMA library for accessing and
parsing of OMM MarketPrice Domain data from Refinitiv Data Feed Direct,
directly from an OMM Provider application, or from the Advanced
Distribution Server.

ex470_MP_WarmStandby showcases an usage of the warm standby 
feature to create two connections to a starting server and a standby 
server in EMA in order to switch between these two servers when the
service is down or connection is lost. This example uses the programmatic 
configuration to enable the warm standby feature.
