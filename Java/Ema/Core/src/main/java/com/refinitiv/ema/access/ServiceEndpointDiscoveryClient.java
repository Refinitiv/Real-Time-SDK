/**
 * ServiceEndpointDiscoveryClient class provides callback interfaces to pass received responses.
 * 
 * <p>Application needs to implement an application client class inheriting from ServiceEndpointDiscoveryClient.<br>
 * In its own class, application needs to override callback methods it desires to use for receiving responses.<br>
 * Default empty callback methods are implemented by ServiceEndpointDiscoveryClient class.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Thread safety of all the methods in this class depends on the user's implementation.</p>
 * 
 * The following code snippet shows basic usage of ServiceEndpointDiscoveryClient class to print received responses to screen.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class AppClient implements ServiceEndpointDiscoveryClient
 * {
 * 		public void onSuccess(ServiceEndpointDiscoveryResp serviceEndpointResp, ServiceEndpointDiscoveryEvent event)
 * 		{
 * 			System.out.println(serviceEndpointResp);
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public void onError(String errorText, ServiceEndpointDiscoveryEvent event)
 * 		{
 * 			System.out.println(errorText);
 * 		}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @see ServiceEndpointDiscovery
 * @see ServiceEndpointDiscoveryResp
 * @see ServiceEndpointDiscoveryEvent
