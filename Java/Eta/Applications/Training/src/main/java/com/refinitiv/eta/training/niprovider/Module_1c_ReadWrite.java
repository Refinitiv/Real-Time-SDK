/**
 * This is the ETA NI Provider Training series of the ETA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step
 * training how to build a ETA OMM NI Provider using the ETA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main c source file for the ETA NI Provider Training application. It is a
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA NI Provider Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * A Non-Interactive Provider (NIP) writes a provider application that 
 * connects to LSEG Real-Time Distribution System and sends a specific
 * set (non-interactive) of information (services, domains, and capabilities).
 * NIPs act like clients in a client-server relationship. Multiple NIPs can
 * connect to the same LSEG Real-Time Distribution System and publish
 * the same items and content.
 * 
 * In this module, the OMM NIP application initializes the ETA Transport 
 * and establish a connection to an ADH server. Once connected, an OMM NIP 
 * can publish information into the ADH cache without needing to handle 
 * requests for the information. The ADH can cache the information and 
 * along with other LSEG Real-Time Distribution System components,
 * provide the information to any NIProvider applications that indicate interest.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any ETA NIP application is to establish network
 * communication with an ADH server. To do so, the OMM NIP typically creates
 * an outbound connection to the well-known hostname and port of an ADH.
 * The OMM NIP uses the Connect function to initiate the connection
 * process and then performs connection initialization processes as needed.
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ./gradlew runniprovidermod1a
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14003 -i ""))
 *
 * or
 *
 * ./gradlew runniprovidermod1a -PcommandLineArgs="[-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>]
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA NI Provider Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, after establishing a connection, ping messages might
 * need to be exchanged. The negotiated ping timeout is available via
 * the Channel. If ping heartbeats are not sent or received within
 * the expected time frame, the connection can be terminated. LSEG
 * recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the
 * size of the ping timeout.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information
 * is being exchanged. For example, there may be long periods of time that
 * elapse between requests made from an OMM NIP application to ADH Infrastructure.
 * In this situation, the NIP would send periodic heartbeat messages to inform
 * the ADH Infrastructure that it is still alive.
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ./gradlew runniprovidermod1b
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14003 -i "" -r 300))
 *
 * or
 *
 * ./gradlew runniprovidermod1b -PcommandLineArgs="[-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>] [-r <Running Time>]"
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
 *
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * ETA NI Provider Training Module 1c: Reading and Writing Data
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, when a client or server Channel.state is 
 * ACTIVE, it is possible for an application to receive 
 * data from the connection. Similarly, when a client or server 
 * Channel.state is ACTIVE, it is possible for an 
 * application to write data to the connection. Writing involves a several 
 * step process. 
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * When a client or server Channel.state is ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to receive data from the connection. The 
 * arrival of this information is often announced by the I/O notification 
 * mechanism that the Channel.socketId is registered with. The ETA 
 * Transport reads information from the network as a byte stream, after 
 * which it determines Buffer boundaries and returns each buffer one by 
 * one.
 * 
 * When a client or server Channel.state is ACTIVE, it is 
 * possible for an application to write data to the connection. Writing 
 * involves a several step process. Because the ETA Transport provides 
 * efficient buffer management, the user is required to obtain a buffer 
 * from the ETA Transport buffer pool. This can be the guaranteed output 
 * buffer pool associated with an Channel. After a buffer is acquired, 
 * the user can populate the Buffer.data and set the Buffer.length 
 * to the number of bytes referred to by data. If queued information cannot 
 * be passed to the network, a function is provided to allow the application 
 * to continue attempts to flush data to the connection. An I/O notification
 * mechanism can be used to help with determining when the network is able 
 * to accept additional bytes for writing. The ETA Transport can continue to
 * queue data, even if the network is unable to write. 
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ./gradlew runniprovidermod1c
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14003 -i "" -r 300))
 *
 * or
 *
 * ./gradlew runniprovidermod1a -PcommandLineArgs="[-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>] [-r <Running Time>] "
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
