 * This package contains the ETA Value Add Reactor. The ETA Reactor is a
 * callback-based connection management and event processing component that
 * will significantly reduce the amount of code an application must write for

 * addition, the Reactor also manages automatic ping handling and outbound
 * buffer flushing for all application types, and provides automatic Consumer
 * and Non-Interactive Provider start-up processing.
