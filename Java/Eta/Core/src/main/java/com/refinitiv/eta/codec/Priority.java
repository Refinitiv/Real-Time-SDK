/**
 * <p>
 * Consumers use {@link Priority} to indicate the stream's level of importance,
 * conveyed by the priority information.When a consumer is aggregating streams
 * on behalf of multiple users, the priority typically corresponds to the number
 * of users interested in the particular stream. A consumer can increase or
 * decrease a stream's associated priority information by issuing a subsequent
 * request message on an already open stream. Priority is represented by a
 * priorityClass value and a priorityCount value.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The priority class indicates the general importance of the stream to the
 * consumer.</li>
 * <li>The priority count indicates the stream's specific importance within the
 * priority class</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The priorityClass value takes precedence over any priorityCount value. For
 * example, a stream with a priorityClass of 5 and priorityCount of 1 has a
 * higher overall priority than a stream with a priorityClass of 3 and a
 * priorityCount of 10,000.
 * <p>
 * Because priority information is optional on a {@link RequestMsg}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If priority information is not present on an initial request to open a
 * stream, it is assumed that the stream has a priorityClass and a priorityCount
 * of 1.</li>
 * <li>If priority information is not present on a subsequent request message on
 * an open stream, this means that the priority has not changed and previously
 * stored priority information continues to apply.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If a consumer aggregates identical streams, the consumer should use the
 * highest priorityClass value. Individual priorityCount values are always
 * combined on a per-priorityClass basis.
 * <p>
 * For example, if a consumer application combines three identical streams:
 * <ul>
 * <li>One with priorityClass 3 and priorityCount 5</li>
 * <li>One with priorityClass 2 and priorityCount 10</li>
 * <li>One with priorityClass 3 and priorityCount of 1</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In this case, the aggregate priority information would be priorityClass 3
 * (i.e., the highest priorityClass) and priorityCount of 6 (the combined
 * priorityCount values for that class level).
