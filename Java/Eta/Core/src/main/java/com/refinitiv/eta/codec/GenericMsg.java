/**
 * A bi-directional ETA message that does not have any implicit interaction
 * semantics associated with it, thus the name generic. Once a stream is
 * established via a request-refresh/status interaction, this message can be
 * sent from consumer to provider as well as from provider to consumer, and can
 * also be leveraged by non-interactive provider applications. Generic messages
 * are transient and are typically not cached by any LSEG Real-Time Distibution 
 * System components. The msgKey of a {@link GenericMsg} does not need to match the
 * {@link MsgKey} information associated with the stream the generic message is
 * flowing on. This allows for the key information to be used independently of
 * the stream. Any specific message usage, msgKey usage, expected interactions,
 * and handling instructions are typically defined by a domain message model
 * specification.
