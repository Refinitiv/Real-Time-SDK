 * code is returned from the method itself.

 * In several cases, positive return values reserved or have special meaning,
 * for example bytes remaining to write to the network. As a result, some
 * negative return codes may be used to indicate success - this is different
 * behavior than the Codec package where any positive value indicates success.
