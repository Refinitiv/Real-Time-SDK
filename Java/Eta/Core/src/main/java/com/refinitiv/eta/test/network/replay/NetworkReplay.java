     * at the moment this method is invoked.
     * <p>
     * Suppose that a byte sequence of length n is read, where 0 &lt;= n &lt;= r.
     * This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first byte in the sequence
     * is at index p and the last byte is at index p + n - 1,
     * where p is the buffer's position at the moment this method is invoked.
     * Upon return the buffer's position will be equal to p + n; its limit will not have changed.
     * <p>
     * A read operation might not fill the buffer, and in fact it might not read any bytes at all.
     * Whether or not it does so depends upon the nature and state of the channel.
     * A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot read any more bytes
     * than are immediately available from the socket's input buffer;
     * similarly, a file channel cannot read any more bytes than remain in the file.
     * It is guaranteed, however, that if a channel is in blocking mode and there is at least one byte remaining
     * in the buffer then this method will block until at least one byte is read.
     * <p>
     * This method may be invoked at any time.
     * If another thread has already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however,
     * then an invocation of this method will block until the first operation is complete.
