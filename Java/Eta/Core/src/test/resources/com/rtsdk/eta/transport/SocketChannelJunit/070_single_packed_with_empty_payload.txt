This  file contains the RIPC handshake, and a single (complete) packed message,
such that the packed message has only one part, and the length of said part is
zero bytes. The message format is as follows: 

XXYZZ

In the message above:
* XX is the two-byte RIPC message length (for the entire message)
* Y is the one-byte RIPC message flag
* ZZ is the two-byte length of the first (and only) packed message. In this
 case, the length is zero, because our payload has no data

The RIPC handshake:
