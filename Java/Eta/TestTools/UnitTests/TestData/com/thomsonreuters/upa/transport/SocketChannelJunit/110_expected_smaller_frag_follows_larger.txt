The input file contains the RIPC handshake, and two fragmented messages
such that the smaller one follows the larger one. The purpose of
this test is to exercise the code related to pooling fragment
buffers. Since the first message is larger than the second one,
we should be able to re-use the same fragment buffer allocated
for the first message.

This expected file contains a "normal" RIPC message with the same
content (data) as the two fragmented messages.
 
The RIPC handshake:

This is a "normal" RIPC message with the same content (data) as the first (larger) fragmented message.

This is a "normal" RIPC message with the same content (data) as the second (smaller) fragmented message.
