	 * multi-part retrieval for OMM containers that support fragmentation.
	 * (Note that FieldList and ElementList containers must be retrieved
	 * in a single part). If the application does not wish to use fragmentation,
	 * it should pass a null PayloadCursor.
	 *
	 * For multi-part retrieval, a PayloadCursor is required. The application will
	 * call this function to retrieve fragments of the cached container until the
	 * cursor indicates the final part has been retrieved (PayloadCursor.isComplete). 
	 * The size of the buffer provided for retrieval will determine the number of 
	 * fragments needed to encode the entire container.
	 *
	 * @param eIter The OMM payload data in the cache entry will be encoded into the
	 * buffer associated with this iterator.
	 * @param cursor The cursor is required to support multi-part (fragmented)
	 * retrieval of the OMM data in the cache entry. Clear the cursor (PayloadCursor.clear)
	 * prior to the first retrieval from the payload entry. The cursor is not needed for
	 * single part retrieval.
	 * @param error The error in formation structure will be populated if payload
	 * entry cache data could not be retrieved.
	 * @return Failure codes (&lt; CodecReturnCodes.SUCCESS) if data could not be
	 * retrieved from the container.
	 * - CodecReturnCodes.BUFFER_TOO_SMALL indicates that the buffer size should be
	 * increased in order to retrieve the data from the entry (single part or multi-part). 
	 * - CodecReturnCodes.SUCCESS is returned when data is successfully encoded into the buffer,
	 * or if there is no data to retrieve from the entry.
	 * - Note that for multi-part retrieval, CodecReturnCodes.SUCCESS only indicates the
	 * successful encoding of the current fragment. Check the state of the PayloadCursor
	 * to determine if the current fragment is the final part.
