Transport API Consumer Training Application Description
Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management

--------
Summary:
--------

Ping or heartbeat messages indicate the continued presence of an application. 
After the consumer’s connection is active, ping messages must be exchanged. 
The negotiated ping timeout is retrieved using the rsslGetChannelInfo() function. 
The connection will be terminated if ping heartbeats are not sent or received 
within the expected time frame.

Detailed Descriptions:
Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of 
an application. These are typically only required when no other information 
is being exchanged. For example, there may be long periods of time that 
elapse between requests made from an OMM consumer application. In this 
situation, the consumer would send periodic heartbeat messages to inform 
the providing application that it is still alive. Because the provider 
application is likely sending more frequent information, providing updates 
on any streams the consumer has requested, it may not need to send 
heartbeats as the other data is sufficient to announce its continued 
presence. It is the responsibility of each connection to manage the sending
and receiving of heartbeat messages.

Application Name:
-----------------

ConsMod1b

------------------
Setup Environment:
------------------

The RDMFieldDictionary and enumtype.def files located in the etc directory
can be located in the directory of execution. If the dictionary files
cannot be found, they are requested from the provider.

-------------------
Command line usage:
-------------------  

ConsMod1b
(runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14002 -i ""))

or

ConsMod1b [-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>]
			
- ConsMod1b -? displays command line options.  

- Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.  

-----------------
Compiling Source:
-----------------

The included makefile is set up to run from the file
locations as presented through the distribution package.
It is set up for building on the Transport API supported 
Solaris or Linux platforms using the supported compilers.

The COMPILE_BITS value in the makefile is used to control
whether 32 or 64 bit version of the application is built.  
If a 64 bit application build is desired, COMPILE_BITS should
be set to 64 (which is the default setting).  If 32 bit 
application build is desired, COMPILE_BITS should be set
to 32.  

The LINKTYPE value in the makefile is used to control
whether the application is built using Transport API static or 
shared libraries. The default build uses Transport API static 
libraries. To use Transport API shared libraries, 
set LINKTYPE=Shared.

To compile, run the gmake command.

Gmake can be obtained at http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
