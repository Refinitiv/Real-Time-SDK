ConsPerf Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------

The purpose of this application is to measure performance of the Transport API,
encoders and decoders in consuming Level I Market Price content directly from an
OMM provider or through the Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution System.

The consumer creates two types of threads:

- A main thread, which collects and records statistical information,

- Consumer threads, each of which create a connection to a provider and request
  market data.

To measure latency, a timestamp is randomly placed in each burst of updates by
the provider.  The consumer then decodes the timestamp from the update to
determine the end-to-end latency.  ConsPerf also supports measurement of posting
latency.

This application also measures memory and CPU usage.  The memory usage measured
is the 'resident set,' or the memory currently in physical use by the
application.  The CPU usage is the total time using the CPU divided by the
total system time (The CPU time is the total across all threads, and as such
this number can be greater than 100% if multiple threads are busy).

For more detailed information on the performance measurement applications,
see the Transport API C Open Source Performance Tools Guide
(PerfTools/Docs/PerfToolsGuide.doc).
