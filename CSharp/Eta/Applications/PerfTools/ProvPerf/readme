ProvPerf Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------

The purpose of this application is to measure performance of the Transport API,
encoders and decoders in providing Level I Market Price content either
directly to an OMM Consumer or to the Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution System.

The provider creates two categories of threads:
- a main thread, which collects and records statistical information
- provider threads, which provide market data for consumer applications.

Consumer connections are balanced among provider threads by the main thread.

The provider may be configured to provide updates at various rates.  To measure
latency, a timestamp is randomly placed in each burst of updates.   The
consumer then decodes the timestamp from the update to determine the end-to-end
latency.

This application also measures memory and CPU usage.  The memory usage measured
is the 'resident set,' or the memory currently in physical use by the
application.  The CPU usage is the total time using the CPU divided by the
total system time (The CPU time is the total across all threads, and as such
this number can be greater than 100% if multiple threads are busy).

For more detailed information on the performance measurement applications,
see the Transport API C Open Source Performance Tools Guide
(PerfTools/Docs/PerfToolsGuide.doc).
