/**
* This is the ETA NI Provider Training series of the ETA Training Suite
* applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step
* training how to build a ETA OMM NI Provider using the ETA Transport layer.
*
* Main c source file for the ETA NI Provider Training application. It is a
* single-threaded client application.
*
************************************************************************
* ETA NI Provider Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
************************************************************************
* Summary:
* A Non-Interactive Provider (NIP) writes a provider application that
* connects to Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution System and sends a specific
* set (non-interactive) of information (services, domains, and capabilities).
* NIPs act like clients in a client-server relationship. Multiple NIPs can
* connect to the same Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution System and publish
* the same items and content.
*
* In this module, the OMM NIP application initializes the ETA Transport
* and establish a connection to an ADH server. Once connected, an OMM NIP
* can publish information into the ADH cache without needing to handle
* requests for the information. The ADH can cache the information and
* along with other Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution System components,
* provide the information to any NIProvider applications that indicate interest.
*
* Detailed Descriptions:
* The first step of any ETA NIP application is to establish network
* communication with an ADH server. To do so, the OMM NIP typically creates
* an outbound connection to the well-known hostname and port of an ADH.
* The OMM NIP uses the Connect function to initiate the connection
* process and then performs connection initialization processes as needed.
*
* Command line usage:
*
* NIProvMod1a.exe
* (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14003 -i ""))
*
* or
*
* NIProvMod1a.exe [-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>]
* (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
*
* Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
*
************************************************************************
* ETA NI Provider Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
************************************************************************
* Summary:
* In this module, after establishing a connection, ping messages might
* need to be exchanged. The negotiated ping timeout is available via
* the Channel. If ping heartbeats are not sent or received within
* the expected time frame, the connection can be terminated. Refinitiv
* recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the
* size of the ping timeout.
*
* Detailed Descriptions:
* Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of
* an application. These are typically only required when no other information
* is being exchanged. For example, there may be long periods of time that
* elapse between requests made from an OMM NIP application to ADH Infrastructure.
* In this situation, the NIP would send periodic heartbeat messages to inform
* the ADH Infrastructure that it is still alive.
*
* Command line usage:
*
* NIProvMod1b.exe
* (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14003 -i "" -r 300))
*
* or
*
* NIProvMod1b.exe [-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>] [-r <Running Time>]
* (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
*
* Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
