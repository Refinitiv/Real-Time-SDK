/*****************************************************************************************
 * This is the ETA Interactive Provider Training series of the ETA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step
 * training how to build a ETA OMM Interactive Provider using the ETA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main C# source file for the ETA Interactive Provider Training application. It is a
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 *****************************************************************************************
 * ETA Interactive Provider Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 *****************************************************************************************
 *
 * Summary:
 *
 * An OMM Interactive Provider application opens a listening socket on a well-known
 * port allowing OMM consumer applications to connect. Once connected, consumers
 * can request data from the Interactive Provider.
 *
 * In this module, the OMM Interactive Provider application opens a listening socket
 * on a well-known port allowing OMM consumer applications to connect.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 *
 * The first step of any ETA Interactive Provider application is to establish
 * a listening socket, usually on a well-known port so that consumer applications
 * can easily connect. The provider uses the Transport.Bind() method to open the port
 * and listen for incoming connection attempts.
 *
 * Whenever an OMM consumer application attempts to connect, the provider uses
 * the IServer.Accept() method to begin the connection initialization process.
 *
 * For this simple training app, the interactive provider only supports a single client.
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ProvMod1a.exe
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-p 14002))
 *
 * or
 *
 * ProvMod1a.exe [-p <SrvrPortNo>]
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
 *
 *****************************************************************************************
 * ETA Interactive Provider Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 *****************************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, after establishing a connection, ping messages might
 * need to be exchanged. The negotiated ping timeout is available via
 * the Channel. If ping heartbeats are not sent or received within
 * the expected time frame, the connection can be terminated. Refinitiv
 * recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the
 * size of the ping timeout.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 *
 * Once the connection is active, the consumer and provider applications
 * might need to exchange ping messages. A negotiated ping timeout is available
 * via Channel corresponding to each connection (this value might differ on
 * a per-connection basis). A connection can be terminated if ping heartbeats
 * are not sent or received within the expected time frame. Refinitiv
 * recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the size of the ping timeout.
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information is
 * being exchanged. Because the provider application is likely sending more frequent
 * information, providing updates on any streams the consumer has requested,
 * it may not need to send heartbeats as the other data is sufficient to announce
 * its continued presence. It is the responsibility of each connection to manage
 * the sending and receiving of heartbeat messages.
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ProvMod1b.exe
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-p 14002 -r 300))
 *
 * or
 *
 * ProvMod1b.exe [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-r <Running Time>]
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
