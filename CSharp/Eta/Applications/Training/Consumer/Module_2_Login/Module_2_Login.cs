/*********************************************************************************
 * This is the ETA Consumer Training series of the ETA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step
 * training how to build a ETA OMM Consumer using the ETA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main CSharp source file for the ETA Consumer Training application. It is a
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 *********************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 *********************************************************************************
 *
 * Summary:
 *
 * In this module, the application initializes the ETA Transport and
 * connects the client. An OMM consumer application can establish a
 * connection to other OMM Interactive Provider applications, including
 * Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution Systems, Refinitiv Data Feed Direct,
 * and Refinitiv Real-Time.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 *
 * The first step of any ETA consumer application is to establish a
 * network connection with its peer component (i.e., another application
 * with which to interact). An OMM consumer typically creates an out-bound
 * connection to the well-known hostname and port of a server (Interactive
 * Provider or ADS). The consumer uses the Channel.connect() function to initiate
 * the connection and then uses the Channel.init() function to complete
 * channel initialization.
 *
 * For this simple training app, only a single channel/connection is used for
 * the entire life of this app.
 *********************************************************************************
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ./ConsMod1a [-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>]
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14002 -i ""))
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
 *
 *********************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 *********************************************************************************
 *
 * Summary:
 *
 * Ping or heartbeat messages indicate the continued presence of an application.
 * After the consumer connection is active, ping messages must be exchanged.
 * The negotiated ping timeout is retrieved using the GetChannelInfo() function.
 * The connection will be terminated if ping heartbeats are not sent or received
 * within the expected time frame.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 *
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information
 * is being exchanged. For example, there may be long periods of time that
 * elapse between requests made from an OMM consumer application. In this
 * situation, the consumer would send periodic heartbeat messages to inform
 * the providing application that it is still alive. Because the provider
 * application is likely sending more frequent information, providing updates
 * on any streams the consumer has requested(like update for market price), it may not need to send
 * heartbeats as the other data is sufficient to announce its continued
 * presence. It is the responsibility of each connection to manage the sending
 * and receiving of heartbeat messages.
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ./ConsMod1b [-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>] [-r <Running Time>]
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14002 -i "" -r 300))
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
 *
 *********************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 1c: Reading and Writing Data
 *********************************************************************************
 *
 * Summary:
 *
 * When channel initialization is complete, the state of the channel
 * Channel.state() is TransportReturnCodes.ACTIVE, and applications can send
 * and receive data.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 *
 * When a client or server Channel.state() is ChannelState.ACTIVE, it is
 * possible for an application to receive data from the connection. The
 * arrival of this information is checked with Select method. The ETA
 * Transport reads information from the network as a byte stream, after
 * which it determines buffer boundaries and returns each buffer one by
 * one.
 *
 * When a client or server Channel.state() is ChannelState.ACTIVE, it is
 * possible for an application to write data to the connection. Writing
 * involves a several step process.
 *
 * Because the ETA Transport provides efficient buffer management, the user is
 * required to obtain a buffer from the ETA Transport buffer pool. This can be
 * the guaranteed output buffer pool associated with a Channel. After a buffer
 * is acquired, the user can populate the Buffer.Data and set the Buffer.Length
 * to the number of bytes referred to by data.
 *
 * If queued information cannot be passed to the network, a function is provided
 * to allow the application to continue attempts to flush data to the
 * connection. An pool mechanism can be used to help with determining when the
 * network is able to accept additional bytes for writing. The ETA Transport can
 * continue to queue data, even if the network is unable to write.
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ./ConsMod1c [-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>] [-r <Running Time>]
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14002 -i "" -r 300))
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
 *
 *********************************************************************************
 * ETA Consumer Training Module 2: Log in
 *********************************************************************************
 *
 * Summary:
 *
 * Applications authenticate using the Login domain model. An OMM consumer must
 * authenticate with a provider using a Login request prior to issuing any other
 * requests or opening any other streams. After receiving a Login request, an
 * Interactive Provider determines whether a user is permissioned to access the
 * system. The Interactive Provider sends back a Login response, indicating to
 * the consumer whether access is granted.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 *
 * After receiving a Login request, an Interactive Provider determines whether
 * a user is permissioned to access the system. The Interactive Provider sends
 * back a Login response, indicating to the consumer whether access is granted.
 *
 * a) If the application is denied, the Login stream is closed, and the
 *    consumer application cannot send additional requests.
 *
 * b) If the application is granted access, the Login response contains
 *    information about available features, such as Posting, Pause and Resume, and
 *    the use of Dynamic Views. The consumer application can use this information
 *    to tailor its interaction with the provider.
 *
 * Content is encoded and decoded using the ETA Message Package and the ETA
 * Data Package.
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *
 * ./ConsMod2 [-h <SrvrHostname>] [-p <SrvrPortNo>] [-i <InterfaceName>] [-r <Running Time>]
 * (runs with a default set of parameters (-h localhost -p 14002 -i "" -r 300))
 * (runs with specified set of parameters, all parameters are optional)
 *
 * Pressing the CTRL+C buttons terminates the program.
