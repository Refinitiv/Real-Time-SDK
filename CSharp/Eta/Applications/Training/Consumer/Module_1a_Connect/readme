Transport API Consumer Training Application Description

Module 1a: Establish network communication

--------
Summary:
--------

In this module, the application initializes the Transport API and
connects the client. An OMM consumer application can establish a
connection to other OMM Interactive Provider applications, including
Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution Systems, Refinitiv Data Feed Direct,
and Refinitiv Real-Time.

Detailed Descriptions:

The first step of any Transport API consumer application is to establish a
network connection with its peer component (i.e., another application
with which to interact). An OMM consumer typically creates an outbound
connection to the well-known hostname and port of a server (Interactive
Provider or ADS). The consumer uses the Connect() method to initiate
the connection and then uses the InitChannel() method to complete
channel initialization.
