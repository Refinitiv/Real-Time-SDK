  - Sets operational model to "USER_DISPATCH"
+ Instantiates an OmmProvider object which:
  - listens on the above port
+ Accepts login request
+ Processes item requests for MarketPrice domain from clients
 - Creates streaming item (refresh and updates) and publishes them
 - Publishes updates 1 per second for 60 seconds.
+ as the number of connected clients changes, published the channel
   information for each connected client
+ publishes channel information of the channel associated with close, login,
   and market price events
+ at the end of the 60 seconds publishing period, prints channel information
   for all clients still connected to the applications
+ Exits
