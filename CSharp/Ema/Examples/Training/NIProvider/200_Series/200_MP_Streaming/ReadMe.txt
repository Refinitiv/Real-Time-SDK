written to the EMA library.

	- specified Channel's host and port
  - Sets the username to "user"
+ Instantiates an OmmProvider object which:
  - initializes the connection and logs into the configured ADH
  - sends down the source directory refresh message with TEST_NI_PUB service info
+ Creates streaming items (refresh and updates) and publishes them
  - MarketPrice IBM.N item on the TEST_NI_PUB service
  - MarketPrice TRI.N item on the TEST_NI_PUB service
+ Publishes updates 1 per second for 60 seconds.
