Detailed Description
====================

251_MP_Perf_KeyByServiceId implements the following high-level steps:

+ Instantiates and modifies an OmmNiProviderConfig object:
  - which reads in the EmaConfig.xml file with:
    - specified SourceDirectory of TEST_NI_PUB
	- specified Channel's host and port
  - Sets the username to "user"
+ Instantiates an OmmProvider object which:
  - initializes the connection and logs into the configured ADH
  - sends down the source directory refresh message with TEST_NI_PUB service info
+ Creates a number of streaming items (refresh and updates) and publishes them
  - refresh messages use ServiceId instead of ServiceName.
+ Publishes a number of updates for 300 seconds.
+ Prints out approximate rates of refreshes and updates every second or so
+ Exits

Note: If needed, these and other details may be modified to fit your local
      environment. For details on standard configuration, refer to the EMA library
      ReadMe.txt file and EMA Configuration Guide.
