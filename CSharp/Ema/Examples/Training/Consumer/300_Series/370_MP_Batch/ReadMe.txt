Summary
=======

The 370_MP_Batch application is provided as an example of OMM
Consumer application written to the EMA library.

This application demonstrates basic usage of the EMA library while opening
multiple item stream via a single request (a.k.A., batch request) and parsing
of OMM MarketPrice data from Refinitiv Data Feed Direct (RDF-D), directly from
an OMM Provider application, or from an Advanced Distribution Server.

370_MP_Batch showcases usage of batch request feature of OMM
Consumer.
