Summary
=======

The 320_Custom_GenericMsg application is provided as an example of
OMM Consumer application written to the EMA library.

This application demonstrates basic usage of the EMA library for accessing
and parsing of OMM Custom data from Refinitiv Data Feed Direct (RDF-D),
directly from an OMM Provider application, or from an Advanced Distribution Server.

320_Custom_GenericMsg showcases usage of GenericMsg in OMM Consumer
application. It demonstrates submission of a GenericMsg as well as receiving
and processing it.
