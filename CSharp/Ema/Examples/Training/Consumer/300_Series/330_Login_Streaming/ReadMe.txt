Summary
=======

The 330_Login_Streaming application is provided as an example of OMM Consumer
application written to the EMA library.

This application demonstrates basic usage of the EMA library for accessing
and parsing of OMM Login and MarketPrice data from Refinitiv Data Feed Direct
(RDF-D), directly from an OMM Provider application, or from an
