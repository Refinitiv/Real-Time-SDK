Summary
=======

The 422_MP_ErrorClient application is provided as an example of
OMM Consumer application written to the EMA library.

This application demonstrates basic usage of the EMA for accessing and parsing
of OMM MarketPrice data from Refinitiv Data Feed Direct (RDF-D), directly from
an OMM Provider application, or from an Advanced Distribution Server.

422_MP_ErrorClient showcases usage of the OmmConsumerErrorClient
functionality. OMM Consumer provides two ways of notifying application about
encountered user errors. By default OMM Consumer throws a respective exception
when an error is encountered. Users may specify to receive a respective callback
instead of exception.
