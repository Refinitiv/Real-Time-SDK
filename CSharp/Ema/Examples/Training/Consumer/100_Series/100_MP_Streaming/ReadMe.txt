Summary
=======

100_MP_Streaming is an example of an OMM Consumer application 
written to the EMA library.

This application demonstrates the basic usage of the EMA library in accessing and
parsing OMM MarketPrice data from either Refinitiv Data Feed Direct (RDF-D), directly
from an OMM Provider application, or from the Advanced Distribution
Server.

100_MP_Streaming illustrates how to open and process a single OMM
item. While processing received messages, the application prints them
to the screen.

  - Overrides desired methods
+ Instantiates an AppClient object to receive and process item messages
+ Instantiates and modifies an OmmConsumerConfig object:
  - Sets the username to "user"
  - Sets the hostname on the preconfigured connection to "localhost"
  - Sets the port on the preconfigured connection to "14002"
+ Instantiates an OmmConsumer object which initializes the connection 
  and logs into the specified server.
+ Opens streaming item interest
  - MarketPrice IBM.N item from the DIRECT_FEED service
+ Processes data received from the API for 60 seconds.
  - Received messages are processed on the API thread of control
