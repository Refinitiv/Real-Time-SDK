EMA_ConsPerf Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------
 
The purpose of this application is to measure performance of EMA API,
in consuming Level I Market Price content directly
from an OMM provider or through the LSEG Real-Time Distribution System. 

The consumer creates two types of threads:
- A main thread, which collects and records statistical information
- Consumer threads, each of which create a connection to a provider and
request market data.

To measure latency, a timestamp is randomly placed in each burst of updates by 
the provider.  The consumer then decodes the timestamp from the update to
determine the end-to-end latency.

This application also measures memory and CPU usage. The memory usage measured 
is the 'resident set,' or the memory currently in physical use by the 
application. The CPU usage is the total time using the CPU divided by the 
total system time. That is, the CPU time is the total across all threads, and 
as such this number can be greater than 100% if multiple threads are busy.
