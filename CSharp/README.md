# Refinitiv Real-Time SDK -  CSharp using .NET Core Edition
This is a proof of concept ETA CSharp to provide pure .NET Core solution. This preview branch includes transport and value add Reactor layers with both client and server side implemenation. This complements the current offering with Java and C languages for RTSDK API. The transport layer API supports TCP/IP transport, buffer management (such as read, write), fragmentation, packing, compression, a codec to implement open message model (OMM). In addition, the value add layer handles adminitrative messages and implements a dispatching/callback mechanism to simplify the application. The public interfaces of ETA CSharp Edition should have a similar look and feel as Java or C Edition unless there is any language specific differences.
