# Refinitiv Real-Time SDK -  CSharp using .NET Core Edition

This is the Refinitiv Real-Time SDK. This SDK consists of the Enterprise Transport API (ETA) written to .NET Core. In this initial release of this flavor of API, ETA fully supports all OMM constructs and messages. Applications maybe written to core ETA or to ValueAdd/Reactor layer with both client and server side implementation. Please note that a client side watchlist implementation and the DACSLock library for use by server applications are forthcoming. The **Enterprise Message API (EMA)** layer is also forthcoming.

This API flavor complements the current offering with Java and C languages for RTSDK API. The transport layer API supports TCP/IP transport, buffer management (such as read, write), fragmentation, packing, compression, a codec to implement open message model (OMM). In addition, the value add layer handles adminitrative messages and implements a dispatching/callback mechanism to simplify the application. The public interfaces of ETA CSharp Edition should have a similar look and feel as Java or C Edition unless there is any language specific differences.

# Documentation
  
Please refer to top level README.md and to CSharp/Eta/README.md to find more information. In this directory, please find the test plan with test results: RTSDK-CSharp-Edition\_Test\_Plan.xlsx

# Installation & Build

Please refer to the Installation Guide for [ETA](Eta/Docs/RTSDK_CSharp_Installation_Guide.pdf) for detailed instructions. In this section are some basic details.

## Install RTSDK

Install all prerequisites list in Software Requirements section. 

Obtain the source **from this repository** on GitHub. It will contain a solution file and all required source to build RTSDK.

## Building RTSDK 

**Using Solution Files and Visual Studio**

Use the provided solution (or `sln`) file to build in **Visual Studio**. 

**Using dotnet**

The RRG package contains all required external dependencies in the CSharp/Eta/NuGetPackages directory. In an environment without internet access, you must add this directory as a nuget source and disable other nuget sources for a build to succeed. Here are some dotnet commands to do so:

        To check existing NuGet sources:   
               dotnet nuget list source

        To add a new NuGet source:
              dotnet nuget add source <full path to your RRG package/CSharp/Eta/NuGetPackages>.

        To disable certain NuGet sources:
              dotnet nuget disable source <specify a source show in the list>.
              Example: dotnet nuget disable source "nuget.org"


To build, navigate to `RTSDK/CSharp` and issue the appropriate dotnet command as follows to build libraries and/or examples:

        dotnet build --configuration <Release|Debug> ETA_NET6.0.sln

        NOTE: 
              - In a GitHub build, the command above builds libraries and places them into Eta/Libs and examples into Eta/Executables
              - In RRG package, it builds only libraries and places them into a custom directory: Eta/Custom/Libs

        GitHub Only, to build specific example: dotnet build -t:Consumer --configuration <Release|Debug> ETA_NET6.0.sln

To build just libraries:

Building RTSDK using dotnet command lines is platform agnostic; i.e., it works the same way on Linux and Windows platforms. To build using Visual Studio is applicable to only Windows.

        dotnet build --configuration Release Eta/Src/Core/Core_NET6.0.csproj
        dotnet build --configuration Release Eta/Src/ValueAdd/ValueAdd_NET6.0.csproj
        dotnet build --configuration Release Eta/Src/Ansi/Ansi_NET6.0.csproj
        dotnet build --configuration Release Eta/Src/AnsiPage/AnsiPage_NET6.0.csproj

        NOTE: In a GitHub build, this builds libraries and places them into Eta/Libs
              In RRG package, this builds libraries and places them into a custom directory: Eta/Custom/Libs

To build just examples: Each example may be built separately using the individual csproj files. Please note that the RRG package also contains a .sln file for each example. Sample command line to build examples:

        dotnet build --configuration Release Eta/Applications/Consumer/Consumer_NET6.0.csproj
        dotnet build --configuration Release Eta/Applications/Consumer/Consumer_NET6.0.sln

        NOTE: Both sln and csproj files build examples and places them into Eta/Executables. 
              Solution files exist only in RRG package
              In RRG package, building examples via csproj or sln link to pre-built libraries located in Eta/Libs
              In a GitHub build, each example expects libraries in Eta/Libs to exist

## Running Examples 

Navigate to `RTSDK/CSharp` and issue the appropriate dotnet command to run various examples:

        dotnet [runtime-options] [path-to-application] [arguments]

Sample command lines to run examples:

        dotnet Eta/Applications/Consumer/bin/Debug/net6.0/Consumer.dll [arguments] 
        dotnet Eta/Applications/Training/Consumer/Module_1a_Connect/bin/Debug/net6.0/Module_1a_Connect.dll [arguments]

- Linux: Run executable:  ./Consumer [arguments]
- Windows: Run executable:  Consumer.exe [arguments]

NOTE: Specify -? as an argument to get a list of possible arguments
