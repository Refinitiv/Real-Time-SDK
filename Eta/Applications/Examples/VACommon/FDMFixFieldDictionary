!
! The unit of measure of the underlying commodity upon which the contract is based. Two groups of u
! nits of measure enumerations are supported.
!
!	Fixed Magnitude UOMs are primarily used in ene
! rgy derivatives and specify a magnitude (such as, MM, Kilo, M, etc.) and the dimension (such a
! s, watt hours, BTU&#39;s) to produce standard fixed measures (such as MWh - Megawatt-hours, MM
! Btu - One million BTUs).
!	The second group, Variable Quantity UOMs, specifies the dimension a
! s a single unit without a magnitude (or more accurately a magnitude of one) and uses the UnitO
! fMeasureQty(1147) field to define the quantity of units per contract. Variable Quantity UOMs a
! re used for both commodities (such as lbs of lean cattle, bushels of corn, ounces of gold) and
!  financial futures.
!
!Examples:
!
!
!	For lean cattle futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure of &
! #39;lbs&#39; with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 40,000, means each lean cattle futures contract 
! represents 40,000 lbs of lean cattle.
!	For Eurodollars futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure of 
! USD with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 1,000,000, means a Eurodollar futures contract represents
!  1,000,000 USD.
!	For gold futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure is oz_tr (Troy ounce) with a Uni
! tOfMeasureQty(1147) of 1,000, means each gold futures contract represents 1,000 troy ounces of
!  gold.
